	abstract = {We develop a new approach for cycle slip detection and repair under high ionospheric activity using undifferenced dual-frequency GPS carrier phase observations. A forward and backward moving window averaging (FBMWA) algorithm and a second-order, time-difference phase ionospheric residual (STPIR) algorithm are integrated to jointly detect and repair cycle slips. The FBMWA algorithm is proposed to detect cycle slips from the widelane ambiguity of Melbourne–Wübbena linear combination observable. The FBMWA algorithm has the advantage of reducing the noise level of widelane ambiguities, even if the GPS data are observed under rapid ionospheric variations. Thus, the detection of slips of one cycle becomes possible. The STPIR algorithm can better remove the trend component of ionospheric variations compared to the normally used first-order, time-difference phase ionospheric residual method. The combination of STPIR and FBMWA algorithms can uniquely determine the cycle slips at both GPS L1 and L2 frequencies. The proposed approach has been tested using data collected under different levels of ionospheric activities with simulated cycle slips. The results indicate that this approach is effective even under active ionospheric conditions.},

This paper provides simple expressions for the writhe of closed curves, and provides a new definition of writhe for open curves. The open curve definition is especially appropriate when the curve is anchored at endpoints on a plane or stretches between two parallel planes. This definition can be especially useful for magnetic flux tubes in the solar atmosphere, and for isotropic rods with ends fixed to a plane.},

Why is it that some knots seem to hold tight while others readily slip apart? Patil et al. develop a theoretical analysis of the stability of knots and find links between topological parameters (twist charge, crossing numbers, handedness) and mechanical stability. The theory is confirmed using simulations and experiments on color-changing fibers that optically show localized stress differences in different parts of the knot as the two strands are pulled apart. The authors show why some common knots slip easily and untie, whereas others hold tight.
Science, this issue p. 71
Knots play a fundamental role in the dynamics of biological and physical systems, from DNA to turbulent plasmas, as well as in climbing, weaving, sailing, and surgery. Despite having been studied for centuries, the subtle interplay between topology and mechanics in elastic knots remains poorly understood. Here, we combined optomechanical experiments with theory and simulations to analyze knotted fibers that change their color under mechanical deformations. Exploiting an analogy with long-range ferromagnetic spin systems, we identified simple topological counting rules to predict the relative mechanical stability of knots and tangles, in agreement with simulations and experiments for commonly used climbing and sailing bends. Our results highlight the importance of twist and writhe in unknotting processes, providing guidance for the control of systems with complex entanglements.
Simple counting rules predict the relative mechanical stability of knots and tangles.

	abstract = {In an increasing number of AI scenarios, collaborations among different organizations or agents (e.g., human and robots, mobile units) are often essential to accomplish an organization-specific mission. However, to avoid leaking useful and possibly proprietary information, organizations typically enforce stringent security constraints on sharing modeling algorithms and data, which significantly limits collaborations. In this work, we introduce the Assisted Learning framework for organizations to assist each other in supervised learning tasks without revealing any organization's algorithm, data, or even task. An organization seeks assistance by broadcasting task-specific but nonsensitive statistics and incorporating others' feedback in one or more iterations to eventually improve its predictive performance. Theoretical and experimental studies, including real-world medical benchmarks, show that Assisted Learning can often achieve near-oracle learning performance as if data and training processes were centralized.},

	abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

	abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

	doi = {10.1109/BigCom51056.2020.00029},
	abstract = {Nowadays distributed machine learning (ML) jobs usually adopt a parameter server (PS) framework to train models over large-scale datasets. Such ML job deploys hundreds of concurrent workers, and model parameter updates are exchanged frequently between workers and PSs. Current practice is that workers and PSs may be placed on different physical servers, bringing uncertainty in jobs' runtime. Also, existing cloud pricing policy often charges a fixed price according to the job's runtime. Although this pricing strategy is simple to implement, such pricing mechanism is not suitable for distributed ML jobs whose runtime is stochastic and can only be estimated according to its placement after job admission. To supplement existing cloud pricing schemes, we design a dynamic pricing and placement algorithm, DPS, for distributed ML jobs. DPS aims to maximize cloud provider's profit, which dynamically calculates unit resource price upon a job's arrival, and determines job's placement to minimize its runtime if offered price is accepted to users. Our design exploits the multi-armed bandit (MAB) technique to learn unknown information based on past sales. DPS balances the exploration and exploitation stage, and selects the best price based on the reward which is related to job runtime. Our learning-based algorithm increases the provider's profit, and achieves a sub-linear regret with both the time horizon and the total job number, compared to benchmark pricing schemes. Extensive evaluations also validates the efficacy of DPS.},

In order to bring more intelligence to edge systems, compared to traditional optimization methodology, and driven by the current deep learning techniques, we propose to integrate the Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques and Federated Learning framework with mobile edge systems, for optimizing mobile edge computing, caching and communication. And thus, we design the “In-Edge AI” framework in order to intelligently utilize the collaboration among devices and edge nodes to exchange the learning parameters for a better training and inference of the models, and thus to carry out dynamic system-level optimization and application-level enhancement while reducing the unnecessary system communication load. “In-Edge AI” is evaluated and proved to have near-optimal performance but relatively low overhead of learning, while the system is cognitive and adaptive to mobile communication systems. Finally, we discuss several related challenges and opportunities for unveiling a promising upcoming future of “In-Edge AI.”},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. 
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. 
Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri or Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla), and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.  For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches during its lifetime, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers use versions of search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it". This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. 
Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated. Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.},

This is followed by a discussion of solar evolution, extending from the birth to the latest stages. As a background for the interpretation of observations related to the solar interior I provide a rather extensive analysis of the sensitivity of solar models to the assumptions underlying their calculation. I then discuss the detailed information about the solar interior that has become available through helioseismic investigations and the detection of solar neutrinos, with further constraints provided by the observed abundances of the lightest elements. Revisions in the determination of the solar surface abundances have led to increased discrepancies, discussed in some detail, between the observational inferences and solar models. I finally briefly address the relation of the Sun to other similar stars and the prospects for asteroseismic investigations of stellar structure and evolution.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method of computing the evolution of low mass stars from the main sequence to the helium flash. Many such computations are handicapped by the fact that the hydrogen burning shell source becomes very thin at a relatively early stage of evolution, and this means that either a very short time step is needed on the red giant branch, or else that some special method must be introduced. The present method has neither handicap: the same procedure is used whether there is a thin shell or not, and the time step can be chosen so that the overall structure of the star changes by a fixed small amount per step. About 100 or 150 steps are necessary to evolve a star to the helium flash. The basic features of the method are that the structure equations are solved using a non-Lagrangian mesh, so that a thin shell if it exists can move slowly through the mesh, even if it moves rapidly with respect to the mass coordinate; and that the composition and the mesh are solved simultaneously with the structure equations, giving greater stability and self-consistency. Although the work described here does not take account of convective mixing of composition, it is suggested that a simple generalization of the equations used here would give a reasonable treatment of both convective and semi-convective mixing, if they occur.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional model, Salammbô-3D, which was initially developed to model the Earth's radiation belts, has been adapted to Jupiter's radiation environment. As a first step, this model has been validated between L = 1 and L = 6 (L: MacIlwain parameter), just inside Io's obit. In order to extend our three-dimensional (3-D) code up to L = 9.5, just inside Europa's orbit, a more realistic magnetic field than the dipole field used before has been introduced in Salammbô. Two magnetic field models are available: The model of Connerney [1981] and the one of Khurana [1997]. Both of them are composed of two parts: An internal magnetic field, intrinsic to the planet, and an external magnetic field, due to the current sheet. Results deduced from Salammbô-3D, using these two different models, will be shown and compared. Then, to validate our 3-D code, from Jupiter up to Europa's orbit, comparisons between simulations and two kinds of observations will be done. Firstly, Salammbô results will be compared with spacecraft data (Pioneer 10 and 11) and secondly with radio observations (Very Large Array: VLA). Indeed, with the help of Salammbô-3D and a synchrotron model, two-dimensional images of Jupiter's synchrotron emission can be deduced. It is then possible to investigate the global radiation belt shape by comparing simulations and VLA observations. Two important results emerge from this study. First, the extension of our model outside Io's orbit aims to show that Io does not play any role on relativistic electron dynamics, i.e., it does not create losses of particles like the inner moons (Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe). The second important result is that contrary to Io, Europa seems to play a significant role in determining the electron distribution in the Jovian radiation belts.},

	abstract = {The stability of a plane current layer is analyzed in the hydromagnetic approximation, allowing for finite isotropic resistivity. The effect of a small layer curvature is simulated by a gravitational field. In an incompressible fluid, there can be three basic types of ``resistive'' instability: a long‐wave ``tearing'' mode, corresponding to breakup of the layer along current‐flow lines; a short‐wave ``rippling'' mode, due to the flow of current across the resistivity gradients of the layer; and a low‐g gravitational interchange mode that grows in spite of finite magnetic shear. The time scale is set by the resistive diffusion time τR and the hydromagnetic transit time τH of the layer. For large S = τR/τH, the growth rate of the ``tearing'' and ``rippling'' modes is of order τR−3/5τH−2/5, and that of the gravitational mode is of order τR−1/3τH−2/3. As S → ∞, the gravitational effect dominates and may be used to stabilize the two nongravitational modes. If the zero‐order configuration is in equilibrium, there are no overstable modes in the incompressible case. Allowance for plasma compressibility somewhat modifies the ``rippling'' and gravitational modes, and may permit overstable modes to appear. The existence of overstable modes depends also on increasingly large zero‐order resistivity gradients as S → ∞. The three unstable modes merely require increasingly large gradients of the first‐order fluid velocity; but even so, the hydromagnetic approximation breaks down as S → ∞. Allowance for isotropic viscosity increases the effective mass density of the fluid, and the growth rates of the ``tearing'' and ``rippling'' modes then scale as τR−2/3τH−1/3. In plasmas, allowance for thermal conductivity suppresses the ``rippling'' mode at moderately high values of S. The ``tearing'' mode can be stabilized by conducting walls. The transition from the low‐g ``resistive'' gravitational mode to the familiar high‐g infinite conductivity mode is examined. The extension of the stability analysis to cylindrical geometry is discussed. The relevance of the theory to the results of various plasma experiments is pointed out. A nonhydromagnetic treatment will be needed to achieve rigorous correspondence to the experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {The tearing instability in a current sheet, which has a sub‐Alfvénic or super‐Alfvénic plasma flow in the current layer, is investigated based on the linearized compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. An initial‐value method is employed to obtain the linear growth rate and eigenmode profiles of the fastest growing mode. The results show that for a sub‐Alfvénic plasma flow parallel to the neutral sheet, the growth rate of the tearing instability is only slightly larger than that of the pure tearing mode without the flow. On the other hand, a large increase in the growth rate of the most unstable mode is observed, when the streaming speed V0m in the central region of the current sheet increases above a critical speed VC≂1.2VA∞. Here VA∞ is the Alfvén speed far away from the current layer. This study shows that when the electric resistivity η is zero, the sausage mode is excited because of a super‐Alfvénic plasma flow parallel to the current sheet. This flow‐induced sausage mode is called the streaming sausage mode. In the presence of a finite resistivity, the streaming sausage mode becomes a mixed sausage–tearing mode, because of the presence of magnetic field line reconnections in the current sheet. This mixed sausage–tearing mode, or simply the streaming tearing mode, has a high growth rate, γ≂0.1τ−1A, where τA is the Alfvén transit time across the current layer. This growth rate is larger than the growth rate of the pure tearing mode, which is approximately the inverse of the geometric mean of the Alfvén time τA and the diffusion time τD across the current layer.},

	abstract = {The present paper comprises a review of kinetic instabilities that may be operative in the solar wind, and how they influence the dynamics thereof. The review is limited to collective plasma instabilities driven by the temperature anisotropies. To limit the scope even further, the discussion is restricted to the temperature anisotropy-driven instabilities within the model of bi-Maxwellian plasma velocity distribution function. The effects of multiple particle species or the influence of field-aligned drift will not be included. The field-aligned drift or beam is particularly prominent for the solar wind electrons, and thus ignoring its effect leaves out a vast portion of important physics. Nevertheless, for the sake of limiting the scope, this effect will not be discussed. The exposition is within the context of linear and quasilinear Vlasov kinetic theories. The discussion does not cover either computer simulations or data analyses of observations, in any systematic manner, although references will be made to published works pertaining to these methods. The scientific rationale for the present analysis is that the anisotropic temperatures associated with charged particles are pervasively detected in the solar wind, and it is one of the key contemporary scientific research topics to correctly characterize how such anisotropies are generated, maintained, and regulated in the solar wind. The present article aims to provide an up-to-date theoretical development on this research topic, largely based on the author’s own work.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional electromagnetic PIC code has been developed on the 512 node Intel Touchstone Delta MIMD parallel computer. This code uses a standard relativistic leapfrog scheme to push particles and a local finite-difference time-domain method to update the electromagnetic fields. The code is implemented using the General Concurrent PIC algorithm which uses a domain decomposition to divide the computation among the processors. The 3D simulation domain can be partitioned into 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional subdomains. Particles must be exchanged between processors as they move among the subdomains. The Intel Delta allows one to use this code for very-large-scale simulations (i.e. over 108 particles and 106 grid cells). The parallel efficiency of this code is measured, and the overall code performance on the Delta is compared with that on Cray supercomputers. It is shown that our code runs with a high parallel efficiency of ≥ 95\% for large size problems. The particle push time achieved is 115 ns/particle/time step for 162 million particles on 512 nodes. Compared with the performance on a single CPU Cray C90, this represents a factor of 58 speedup. It is also shown that the finite-difference method for the field solve is significantly more efficient than transform methods on parallel computers. The field solve time is {\textless} 0.7\% of total time for problems with 77 particles/cell, and it is {\textless} 3\% even for problems with 7 particles/cell.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal. A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of {\textbackslash}federated optimization.},

	abstract = {The heating of ions downstream of the x-line during magnetic reconnection is explored using full-particle simulations, test particle simulations, and analytic analysis. Large-scale particle simulations reveal that the ion temperature increases sharply across the boundary layer that separates the upstream plasma from the Alfvénic outflow. This boundary layer, however, does not take the form of a classical switch-off shock as discussed in the Petschek reconnection model, so the particle heating cannot be calculated from the magnetohydrodynamic, slow-shock prediction. Test particle trajectories in the fields from the simulations reveal that ions crossing the narrow boundary into the exhaust instead behave like pickup particles: they gain both a directed outflow and an effective thermal speed given by the flow speed v0 of the exhaust. The detailed dynamics of these particles are explored by taking 1-D cuts of the simulation data across the exhaust, transforming to the deHoffman-Teller frame, and calculating explicitly the increment in the temperature, miv02/3, with mi, the ion mass. We compare the model predictions with the temperature increment in solar wind exhausts measured by the ACE and Wind spacecraft, confirming that the temperature increment is proportional to the ion mass. The Wind data from 22 high-shear exhaust encounters confirm the scaling of the proton temperature increment with the square of the exhaust velocity. However, the temperature increments are consistently lower than the model prediction. Implications for understanding the production of high-energy ions in flares and the broader universe are discussed.},

	abstract = {Models of magnetic field line merging that consider processes in a limited region around the magnetic X line, within which the external magnetic fields are roughly uniform and antiparallel, are reviewed. Part 1 describes the concept of magnetic merging and then considers the models based on a hydromagnetic approach. The models developed by Sweet and Parker, by Petschek, and by Sonnerup and Yeh and Axford are shown to be fundamentally consistent, representing different aspects of the same problem. The model of Sweet and Parker describes the small region around the neutral line where magnetic field diffusion is the dominant process. The inclusion of inertial as well as finite resistivity effects allows an extension of their model to collisionless plasmas. Petschek's model represents a system with a boundary condition of uniform field at the sides; it has been extended and formulated in a mathematically precise manner. The nonsingular model of Sonnerup and of Yeh and Axford has special boundary conditions at the sides producing localized slow mode MHD expansion fans in the external flow; the singular models and the compressible similarity models are physically unrealizable. The maximum merging rate corresponds to flow into the diffusion region at the local Alfven speed, which, however, can be made arbitrarily large by slow mode MHD expansion if suitable boundary conditions are present.},

	abstract = {Magnetic reconnection converts, often explosively, storedmagnetic energy to particle energy in space and in the laboratory. Through processes operating on length scales that are tiny, it facilitates energy conversion over dimensions of, in some cases, hundreds of Earth radii. In addition, it is the mechanism behind large current disruptions in fusion machines, and it can explain eruptive behavior in astrophysics. We have known about the importance of magnetic reconnection for quite some time based on space observations. Theory and modeling employed magnetized fluids, a very simplistic description. While successful at modeling the large‐scale consequences of reconnection, it is ill suited to describe the engine itself. This is because, at its heart, magnetic reconnection in space is kinetic, that is, governed by the intricate interaction of charged particles with the electromagnetic fields they create. This complex interaction occurs in very localized regions and involves very short temporal variations. Researching reconnection requires the ability to measure these processes as well as to express them in models vastly more complex than fluid approaches. Until very recently, neither of these capabilities existed. With the advent of NASA\&\#39;s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and modern modeling advances, this has now changed, and we have now determined its small‐scale structure in exquisite detail. In this paper, we review recent research results to predict what will be achieved in the future. We discuss how reconnection contributes to the evolution of larger‐scale systems, and its societal impacts in the context of threatening space hazards, customarily referred to as “space weather.” Plain Language Summary In space, huge amounts of energy are released explosively by a mysterious mechanism: magnetic reconnection. Reconnection can abruptly convert energy stored in magnetic fields to energy in charged particles, and power such diverse phenomena as solar and stellar flares, magnetic storms and aurorae in near‐Earth space, and major disruptions in magnetically confined fusion devices. It is behind many of the dangerous effects associated with space weather, including damage to satellites, endangering astronauts, and impacting the power grid and pipelines. Understanding reconnection enables us to quantitatively describe and predict these magnetic explosions. Therefore, magnetic reconnection has been at the forefront of scientific interest for many years, and will be for many more. Measuring reconnection is incredibly difficult. However, recently scientists have been able to peek into its machinery. Combining measurements from NASA\&\#39;s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission with supercomputer modeling, scientists have now been able to analyze the inner workings of this elusive mechanism. Even though open questions remain, this new understanding has broad implications. Here, we describe magnetic reconnection, where it plays a role, its impacts on society, and what we now know about it. We point to future research challenges, including implications and the utility of our recently developed knowledge. There is an imprecise—but useful—analogy to rubber bands that helps us picture magnetic reconnection. A loose rubber band cannot hold a pile of pencils in place, but a stretched rubber band can. This is because it takes energy to stretch the rubber band, and that energy can be thought of as stored in the rubber band. The energy in the stretched rubber band holds the pencils in place. The more you stretch a rubber band, themore energy it stores. Eventually, if you stretch a rubber band toomuch, it breaks, providing a painful lesson of how much energy it can hold! There are ways that magnetic fields are analogous to rubber bands. Magnetic fields are invisible and intangible but permeate all space.

The Sun also has a magnetic field, shaped vastly different than Earth\&\#39;s, which is felt 10 billion miles away! Like a rubber band, when magnetic fields get stretched, they store energy. It was historically thought that lines of magnetic field could not break, no matter how stretched they get. Unlike a rubber band, a single magnetic field line cannot break because magnetic fields cannot have free ends. However, if there is another stretched magnetic field line nearby pointing in the opposite direction, they can simultaneously break and cross connect so that there is never a free end. This is sketched in Figure 1. The light blue lines at the top and bottom are magnetic field lines pointing to the left and right, respectively, against a backdrop of the electric current. Magnetic field lines enter the shaded box in the center of Figure 1, called the diffusion region, where they effectively break and the broken ends from each immediately cross connect with each other. The field lines are said to have reconnected. The resulting two strongly bent magnetic field lines, threading the diffusion region, are stretched like rubber bands. They straighten out to the left and right and release their energy. The matter in space is typically a super‐heated gas called a plasma. Plasmas, the “fourth state of matter” joining solids, liquids, and gases, are so hot that some or all the atoms making them up cannot stay together—they break up into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions that move fast enough to not recombine into neutral matter. To be a plasma, its temperature must be high enough and its density low enough. It is said that 99\% of the knownmaterial in the universe is in the plasma state. The fact that the plasma is present is very important for magnetic reconnection. The magnetic field lines in Figure 1 thread the ambient plasma, shown as light blue circles. The charged particles move with the magnetic field as they move toward the diffusion region. As the bent reconnected magnetic field lines sling out like rubber bands, the plasma mostly moves with the magnetic field. This produces two jets of plasma moving away from the diffusion region, shown by the ovals to its left and right. As the magnetic field line slings out, the plasma residing at the boundaries between magnetic fields that have reconnected already and those that have not is also accelerated. Depending on where magnetic reconnection in space is happening, the jets can be faster than a million miles per hour! In addition to producing jets, magnetic reconnection heats the plasma, which is depicted by the shading of the plasma in the jets. The heating can happenwithin the diffusion region or at the boundaries between reconnected and unreconnected magnetic fields. This heating can be significant—depending on the setting, up to {\textasciitilde}1/2 of the energy released by magnetic fields can go into heating the plasma. Figure 1. Simplified two‐dimensional schematic diagram of magnetic reconnection. Oppositely directed magnetic fields (light blue lines) and ambient plasma (light blue circles) move into the diffusion region (shaded box in the center), where magnetic reconnection occurs. The plasma is heated and accelerated into jets to the left and right (shaded blue ovals). 10.1029/2018JA025935 Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics HESSE AND CASSAK 2 of 24 The reason we care about magnetic reconnection is that it efficiently converts energy, both in the form of directed motion (the jets) and random motion (the increase in temperature). It is quite common for a magnetic field to change directions, so magnetic reconnection occurs in many settings. It is the mechanism behind solar flares, enormous bursts of light in the atmosphere of the Sun, which release up to 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10) joules of energy. For perspective, if we could harness all the energy released in a single large flare for human use, it would supply enough energy for the whole world for about 20,000 years! Magnetic reconnection also happens in the space surrounding Earth. Earth\&\#39;s magnetic field forms a bubble around Earth protecting it from the solar wind, a stream of plasma and magnetic fields emanating from the Sun. When the magnetic field in the solar wind points in the opposite direction as Earth\&\#39;s, magnetic reconnection at the edge of the bubble occurs. This sets the magnetic field and plasma inside Earth\&\#39;s magnetic bubble into motion, accumulating its magnetic field on the side of Earth away from the Sun. There, magnetic fields are again oppositely directed, and magnetic reconnection drives hot plasma toward Earth during what are called geomagnetic storms or substorms. Some of the ambient plasma penetrates all the way down to Earth\&\#39;s atmosphere, where it excites molecules in the atmosphere, and they give off light as they de‐excite. This is the origin of the auroral lights seen near Earth\&\#39;s poles. Consequently, researching magnetic reconnection is a major aspect of understanding the Sun and the Sun\&\#39;s impa},

The most important goal of MMS is to conduct a definitive experiment to determine what causes magnetic field lines to reconnect in a collisionless plasma. The significance of the MMS results will extend far beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere because reconnection is known to occur in interplanetary space and in the solar corona where it is responsible for solar flares and the disconnection events known as coronal mass ejections. Active research is also being conducted on reconnection in the laboratory and specifically in magnetic-confinement fusion devices in which it is a limiting factor in achieving and maintaining electron temperatures high enough to initiate fusion. Finally, reconnection is proposed as the cause of numerous phenomena throughout the universe such as comet-tail disconnection events, magnetar flares, supernova ejections, and dynamics of neutron-star accretion disks. The MMS mission design is focused on answering specific questions about reconnection at the Earth’s magnetosphere. The prime focus of the mission is on determining the kinetic processes occurring in the electron diffusion region that are responsible for reconnection and that determine how it is initiated; but the mission will also place that physics into the context of the broad spectrum of physical processes associated with reconnection. Connections to other disciplines such as solar physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics are expected to be made through theory and modeling as informed by the MMS results.},

	abstract = {The Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) Reconnection Challenge project is presented and the important results, which are presented in a series of companion papers, are summarized. Magnetic reconnection is studied in a simple Harris sheet configuration with a specified set of initial conditions, including a finite amplitude, magnetic island perturbation to trigger the dynamics. The evolution of the system is explored with a broad variety of codes, ranging from fully electromagnetic particle in cell (PIC) codes to conventional resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) codes, and the results are compared. The goal is to identify the essential physics which is required to model collisionless magnetic reconnection. All models that include the Hall effect in the generalized Ohm's law produce essentially indistinguishable rates of reconnection, corresponding to nearly Alfvénic inflow velocities. Thus the rate of reconnection is insensitive to the specific mechanism which breaks the frozen-in condition, whether resistivity, electron inertia, or electron thermal motion. The reconnection rate in the conventional resistive MHD model, in contrast, is dramatically smaller unless a large localized or current dependent resistivity is used. The Hall term brings the dynamics of whistler waves into the system. The quadratic dispersion property of whistlers (higher phase speed at smaller spatial scales) is the key to understanding these results. The implications of these results for trying to model the global dynamics of the magnetosphere are discussed.},

	abstract = {Dipolarization fronts (DFs) as earthward propagating flux ropes (FRs) in the Earth's magnetotail are presented and investigated with a three-dimensional (3-D) global hybrid simulation for the first time. In the simulation, several small-scale earthward propagating FRs are found to be formed by multiple X line reconnection in the near tail. During their earthward propagation, the magnetic field Bz of the FRs becomes highly asymmetric due to the imbalance of the reconnection rates between the multiple X lines. At the later stage, when the FRs approach the near-Earth dipole-like region, the antireconnection between the southward/negative Bz of the FRs and the northward geomagnetic field leads to the erosion of the southward magnetic flux of the FRs, which further aggravates the Bz asymmetry. Eventually, the FRs merge into the near-Earth region through the antireconnection. These earthward propagating FRs can fully reproduce the observational features of the DFs, e.g., a sharp enhancement of Bz preceded by a smaller amplitude Bz dip, an earthward flow enhancement, the presence of the electric field components in the normal and dawn-dusk directions, and ion energization. Our results show that the earthward propagating FRs can be used to explain the DFs observed in the magnetotail. The thickness of the DFs is on the order of several ion inertial lengths, and the electric field normal to the front is found to be dominated by the Hall physics. During the earthward propagation from the near-tail to the near-Earth region, the speed of the FR/DFs increases from 150 km/s to 1000 km/s. The FR/DFs can be tilted in the GSM (x, y) plane with respect to the y (dawn-dusk) axis and only extend several Earth radii in this direction. Moreover, the structure and evolution of the FRs/DFs are nonuniform in the dawn-dusk direction, which indicates that the DFs are essentially 3-D.},

In this Letter, we present the first evidence of such a secondary island near the center of an ion diffusion region, which is consistent with the action of the secondary island instability occurring in the vicinity of the X line. The island is squashed in the z direction with a strong core magnetic field. Energetic electrons with anisotropic or field-aligned bidirectional fluxes are found in the ion diffusion region, and the enhancement of energetic electron fluxes is more obvious inside the secondary island.},

	abstract = {This paper highlights the scientific and computational challenges facing the Fusion Simulation Project (FSP). The primary objective is to develop advanced software designed to use leadership-class computers for carrying out multiscale physics simulations to provide information vital to delivering a realistic integrated fusion simulation model with unprecedented physics fidelity. This multiphysics capability will be unprecedented in that in the current FES applications domain, the largest-scale codes are used to carry out first-principles simulations of mostly individual phenomena in realistic 3D geometry while the integrated models are much smaller-scale, lower-dimensionality codes with significant empirical elements used for modeling and designing experiments. The FSP is expected to be the most up-to-date embodiment of the theoretical and experimental understanding of magnetically confined thermonuclear plasmas and to provide a living framework for the simulation of such plasmas as the associated physics understanding continues to advance over the next several decades. Substantive progress on answering the outstanding scientific questions in the field will drive the FSP toward its ultimate goal of developing a reliable ability to predict the behavior of plasma discharges in toroidal magnetic fusion devices on all relevant time and space scales. From a computational perspective, the fusion energy science application goal to produce high-fidelity, whole-device modeling capabilities will demand computing resources in the petascale range and beyond, together with the associated multicore algorithmic formulation needed to address burning plasma issues relevant to ITER — a multibillion dollar collaborative device involving seven international partners representing over half the world's population. Even more powerful exascale platforms will be needed to meet the future challenges of designing a demonstration fusion reactor (DEMO). Analogous to other major applied physics modeling projects (e.g., ASCI), the FSP will need to develop software in close collaboration with experimental researchers and validated against experimental data from tokamaks around the world. Specific examples of expected advances needed to enable a premier comprehensive integrated modeling capability are discussed.},

This is also typical for fully ionized plasmas. However, the situation in fully ionized plasma is completely different from that in a solid state, gases, or partially ionized plasmas, where current is simply proportional to the applied electric field and the corresponding conductivity is determined by the collisions between charged particles and neutrals. In fully ion-ized plasmas, a homogeneous electric field causes {\textbackslash}( {\textbackslash}vec E {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}vec B {\textbackslash}) drift both for electrons and ions perpendicular to the electric field and no current in the direction of the electric field is generated.},

	abstract = {Scientific simulation, which provides a natural bridge between theory and experiment, is an essential tool for understanding complex plasma behaviour. Recent advances in simulations of magnetically confined plasmas are reviewed in this paper, with illustrative examples, chosen from associated research areas such as microturbulence, magnetohydrodynamics and other topics. Progress has been stimulated, in particular, by the exponential growth of computer speed along with significant improvements in computer technology. The advances in both particle and fluid simulations of fine-scale turbulence and large-scale dynamics have produced increasingly good agreement between experimental observations and computational modelling. This was enabled by two key factors: (a) innovative advances in analytic and computational methods for developing reduced descriptions of physics phenomena spanning widely disparate temporal and spatial scales and (b) access to powerful new computational resources. Excellent progress has been made in developing codes for which computer run-time and problem-size scale well with the number of processors on massively parallel processors (MPPs). Examples include the effective usage of the full power of multi-teraflop (multi-trillion floating point computations per second) MPPs to produce three-dimensional, general geometry, nonlinear particle simulations that have accelerated advances in understanding the nature of turbulence self-regulation by zonal flows. These calculations, which typically utilized billions of particles for thousands of time-steps, would not have been possible without access to powerful present generation MPP computers and the associated diagnostic and visualization capabilities. In looking towards the future, the current results from advanced simulations provide great encouragement for being able to include increasingly realistic dynamics to enable deeper physics insights into plasmas in both natural and laboratory environments. This should produce the scientific excitement which will help to (a) stimulate enhanced cross-cutting collaborations with other fields and (b) attract the bright young talent needed for the future health of the field of plasma science.},

	abstract = {A pedagogical review of the historical development and current status (as of early 2000) of systematic statistical theories of plasma turbulence is undertaken. Emphasis is on conceptual foundations and methodology, not practical applications. Particular attention is paid to equations and formalism appropriate to strongly magnetized, fully ionized plasmas. Extensive reference to the literature on neutral-fluid turbulence is made, but the unique properties and problems of plasmas are emphasized throughout. Discussions are given of quasilinear theory, weak-turbulence theory, resonance-broadening theory, and the clump algorithm. The direct-interaction approximation (DIA) is developed as a central focus of the article, and its relationship to the earlier plasma theories is explained. Various methods of renormalized perturbation theory are described, then unified with the aid of the generating-functional formalism of Martin, Siggia, and Rose. A general expression for the renormalized dielectric function is deduced and discussed in detail. Modern approaches such as decimation and PDF methods are described. Derivations of DIA-based Markovian closures are discussed. The eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure is shown to be nonrealizable in the presence of waves, and a new realizable Markovian closure is presented. The test-field model and a realizable modification thereof are also summarized. Numerical solutions of various closures for some plasma-physics paradigms are reviewed. The variational approach to bounds on transport is developed. Miscellaneous topics include Onsager symmetries for turbulence, the interpretation of entropy balances for both kinetic and fluid descriptions, self-organized criticality, statistical interactions between disparate scales, and the roles of both mean and random shear. Appendices are provided on Fourier transform conventions, dimensional and scaling analysis, the derivations of nonlinear gyrokinetic and gyrofluid equations, stochasticity criteria for quasilinear theory, formal aspects of resonance-broadening theory, Novikov's theorem, the treatment of weak inhomogeneity, the derivation of the Vlasov and gyrokinetic weak-turbulence wave kinetic equation from a fully renormalized description, some features of a code for solving the DIA and related Markovian closures, the details of the solution of the EDQNM closure for a solvable three-wave model, and the notation used in the article.},

	abstract = {The magnetosphere is the outermost layer of the geospace, and the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere is the key element of the space weather cause-and-effect chain process from the Sun to Earth, which is one of the most challenging scientific problems in the geospace weather study. The nonlinearity, multiple component, and time-dependent nature of the geospace make it very difficult to describe the physical process in geospace using traditional analytic analysis approach. Numerical simulations, a new research tool developed in recent decades, have a deep impact on the theory and application of the geospace. MHD simulations started at the end of the 1970s, and the initial study was limited to two-dimensional (2D) cases. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of the geospace, 3D MHD simulations emerged in the 1980s, in an attempt to model the large-scale structures and fundamental physical processes in the magnetosphere. They started to combine with the space exploration missions in the 1990s and make comparisons with observations. Physics-based space weather forecast models started to be developed in the 21st century. Currently only a few space-power countries such as USA and Japan have developed 3D magnetospheric MHD models. With the rapid advance of space science in China, we have developed a new global MHD model, namely PPMLR-MHD, which has high order spatial accuracy and low numerical dissipation. In this review, we will briefly introduce the global 3D MHD modeling, especially the PPMLR-MHD code, and summarize our recent work based on the PPMLR-MHD model, with an emphasis on the interaction of interplanetary shocks with the magnetosphere, large-scale current systems, reconnection voltage and transpolar potential drop, and Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability at the magnetopause.},

	abstract = {Mobile communications have been undergoing a generational change every ten years or so. However, the time difference between the so-called “G’s” is also decreasing. While fifth-generation (5G) systems are becoming a commercial reality, there is already significant interest in systems beyond 5G, which we refer to as the sixth generation (6G) of wireless systems. In contrast to the already published papers on the topic, we take a top-down approach to 6G. More precisely, we present a holistic discussion of 6G systems beginning with lifestyle and societal changes driving the need for next-generation networks. This is followed by a discussion into the technical requirements needed to enable 6G applications, based on which we dissect key challenges and possibilities for practically realizable system solutions across all layers of the Open Systems Interconnection stack (i.e., from applications to the physical layer). Since many of the 6G applications will need access to an order-of-magnitude more spectrum, utilization of frequencies between 100 GHz and 1 THz becomes of paramount importance. As such, the 6G ecosystem will feature a diverse range of frequency bands, ranging from below 6 GHz up to 1 THz. We comprehensively characterize the limitations that must be overcome to realize working systems in these bands and provide a unique perspective on the physical and higher layer challenges relating to the design of next-generation core networks, new modulation and coding methods, novel multiple-access techniques, antenna arrays, wave propagation, radio frequency transceiver design, and real-time signal processing. We rigorously discuss the fundamental changes required in the core networks of the future, such as the redesign or significant reduction of the transport architecture that serves as a major source of latency for time-sensitive applications. This is in sharp contrast to the present hierarchical network architectures that are not suitable to realize many of the anticipated 6G services. While evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of key candidate 6G technologies, we differentiate what may be practically achievable over the next decade, relative to what is possible in theory. Keeping this in mind, we present concrete research challenges for each of the discussed system aspects, providing inspiration for what follows.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

We propose to foster a new systems machine learning research community at the intersection of the traditional systems and ML communities, focused on topics such as hardware systems for ML, software systems for ML, and ML optimized for metrics beyond predictive accuracy. To do this, we describe a new conference, MLSys, that explicitly targets research at the intersection of systems and machine learning with a program committee split evenly between experts in systems and ML, and an explicit focus on topics at the intersection of the two.},

Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

	abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge},

The radii show a bimodal distribution, with two peaks corresponding to smaller planets (likely rocky) and larger intermediate-size planets, respectively. While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R⊕) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H2–He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H2O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in the mass range of 10–15 M⊕, if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have radii of 2.5 R⊕, which exactly match the second peak of the exoplanet radius bimodal distribution. Any planet in the 2- to 4-R⊕ range requires a gas envelope of at most a few mass percentage points, regardless of the core composition. To resolve the ambiguity of internal compositions, we use a growth model and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that many intermediate-size planets are “water worlds.”},

If, instead of a rotating sphere, one has a prismatic volume of fluid, it is possible to construct migratory dynamo waves The dynamo waves are discussed in relation to the solar convective zone; it is shown that such waves can account for many of the principal features of the observed solar magnetic activity},

	abstract = {Charged particles can be accelerated to high energies by collisionless shock waves in astrophysical environments, such as supernova remnants. By interacting with the magnetized ambient medium, these shocks can transfer energy to particles. Despite increasing efforts in the characterization of these shocks from satellite measurements at the Earth's bow shock and powerful numerical simulations, the underlying acceleration mechanism or a combination thereof is still widely debated. Here, we show that astrophysically relevant super-critical quasi-perpendicular magnetized collisionless shocks can be produced and characterized in the laboratory. We observe characteristics of super-criticality in the shock profile as well as the energization of protons picked up from the ambient gas to hundreds of keV. Kinetic simulations modelling the laboratory experiment identified shock surfing as the proton acceleration mechanism. Our observations not only provide the direct evidence of early stage ion energization by collisionless shocks, but they also highlight the role this particular mechanism plays in energizing ambient ions to feed further stages of acceleration. Furthermore, our results open the door to future laboratory experiments investigating the possible transition to other mechanisms, when increasing the magnetic field strength, or the effect induced shock front ripples could have on acceleration processes.},

Thomson scattering of a probe laser beam was used to observe the interaction of a laser-driven, supersonic piston plasma expanding through an ambient plasma in an external magnetic field. From the Thomson-scattered spectra we measure time-resolved profiles of electron density, temperature, and ion flow speed, as well as spatially resolved magnetic fields from proton radiography. We observe direct evidence of the coupling between piston and ambient plasmas, including the acceleration of ambient ions driven by magnetic and pressure gradient electric fields, and deformation of the piston ion flow, key steps in the formation of magnetized collisionless shocks. Even before a shock has fully formed, we observe strong density compressions and electron heating associated with the pileup of piston ions. The results demonstrate that laboratory experiments can probe particle velocity distributions relevant to collisionless shocks, and can complement, and in some cases overcome, the limitations of similar measurements undertaken by spacecraft missions.},

Here we present the first laboratory generation of high-Mach number magnetized collisionless shocks created through the interaction of an expanding laser-driven plasma with a magnetized ambient plasma. Time-resolved, two-dimensional imaging of plasma density and magnetic fields shows the formation and evolution of a supercritical shock propagating at magnetosonic Mach number \$M\_\{ms\}{\textbackslash}approx12\$. Particle-in-cell simulations constrained by experimental data show in detail the shock formation, separate reflection dynamics of C\${\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\$ and H\${\textasciicircum}\{+1\}\$ ions in the multi-species ambient plasma, and density and magnetic field compressions and overshoots in the shock layer. The development of this experimental platform complements present remote sensing and spacecraft observations, and opens the way for controlled laboratory investigations of high-Mach number collisionless shocks, including the mechanisms and efficiency of particle acceleration.},

	abstract = {A study of the transition from collisional to collisionless plasma flows has been carried out at the National Ignition Facility using high Mach number (M{\textgreater}4) counterstreaming plasmas. In these experiments, CD-CD and CD-CH planar foils separated by 6–10 mm are irradiated with laser energies of 250 kJ per foil, generating ∼1000 km/s plasma flows. Varying the foil separation distance scales the ion density and average bulk velocity and, therefore, the ion-ion Coulomb mean free path, at the interaction region at the midplane. The characteristics of the flow interaction have been inferred from the neutrons and protons generated by deuteron-deuteron interactions and by x-ray emission from the hot, interpenetrating, and interacting plasmas. A localized burst of neutrons and bright x-ray emission near the midpoint of the counterstreaming flows was observed, suggesting strong heating and the initial stages of shock formation. As the separation of the CD-CH foils increases we observe enhanced neutron production compared to particle-in-cell simulations that include Coulomb collisions, but do not include collective collisionless plasma instabilities. The observed plasma heating and enhanced neutron production is consistent with the initial stages of collisionless shock formation, mediated by the Weibel filamentation instability.},

In this paper we present an approach to multi--task learning based on the minimization of regularization functionals similar to existing ones, such as the one for Support Vector Machines (SVMs), that have been successfully used in the past for single--task learning. Our approach allows to model the relation between tasks in terms of a novel kernel function that uses a task--coupling parameter. We implement an instance of the proposed approach similar to SVMs and test it empirically using simulated as well as real data. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than existing multi--task learning methods and largely outperforms single--task learning using SVMs.},

	abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robotâ s Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},

In practice, they are playing a crucial role in harnessing the power of massive amounts of data which we are currently producing every day in our digital world. In general, the process of building a high-quality machine learning model is an iterative, complex and time-consuming process that involves trying diﬀerent algorithms and techniques in addition to having a good experience with eﬀectively tuning their hyper-parameters. In particular, conducting this process eﬃciently requires solid knowledge and experience with the various techniques that can be employed. With the continuous and vast increase of the amount of data in our digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there was a crucial need for automating the process of building good machine learning models. In the last few years, several techniques and frameworks have been introduced to tackle the challenge of automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. The main aim of these techniques is to reduce the role of human in the loop and ﬁll the gap for non-expert machine learning users by playing the role of the domain expert.},

However, building a high-quality DL system for a speciﬁc task highly relies on human expertise, hindering its wide application. Meanwhile, automated machine learning (AutoML) is a promising solution for building a DL system without human assistance and is being extensively studied. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. According to the DL pipeline, we introduce AutoML methods –– covering data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS) –– with a particular focus on NAS, as it is currently a hot sub-topic of AutoML. We summarize the representative NAS algorithms’ performance on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and further discuss the following subjects of NAS methods: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, joint hyperparameter and architecture optimization, and resource-aware NAS. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the existing AutoML methods for future research.},

	abstract = {Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the sub-ﬁeld of machine learning that aims at automating, to some extend, all stages of the design of a machine learning system. In the context of supervised learning, AutoML is concerned with feature extraction, pre processing, model design and post processing. Major contributions and achievements in AutoML have been taking place during the recent decade. We are therefore in perfect timing to look back and realize what we have learned. This chapter aims to summarize the main ﬁndings in the early years of AutoML. More speciﬁcally, in this chapter an introduction to AutoML for supervised learning is provided and an historical review of progress in this ﬁeld is presented. Likewise, the main paradigms of AutoML are described and research opportunities are outlined.},

	abstract = {In VIRTUAL the federated network of the server and the clients is treated as a star-shaped Bayesian network, and learning is performed on the network using approximated variational inference, and it is shown that this method is effective on real-world federated datasets. In classical federated learning a central server coordinates the training of a single model on a massively distributed network of devices. This setting can be naturally extended to a multi-task learning framework, to handle real-world federated datasets that typically show strong non-IID data distributions among devices. Even though federated multi-task learning has been shown to be an effective paradigm for real world datasets, it has been applied only to convex models. In this work we introduce VIRTUAL, an algorithm for federated multi-task learning with non-convex models. In VIRTUAL the federated network of the server and the clients is treated as a star-shaped Bayesian network, and learning is performed on the network using approximated variational inference. We show that this method is effective on real-world federated datasets, outperforming the current state-of-the-art for federated learning.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) refers to learning a high quality global model based on decentralized data storage, without ever copying the raw data. A natural scenario arises with data created on mobile phones by the activity of their users. Given the typical data heterogeneity in such situations, it is natural to ask how can the global model be personalized for every such device, individually. In this work, we point out that the setting of Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), where one optimizes for a fast, gradient-based, few-shot adaptation to a heterogeneous distribution of tasks, has a number of similarities with the objective of personalization for FL. We present FL as a natural source of practical applications for MAML algorithms, and make the following observations. 1) The popular FL algorithm, Federated Averaging, can be interpreted as a meta learning algorithm. 2) Careful fine-tuning can yield a global model with higher accuracy, which is at the same time easier to personalize. However, solely optimizing for the global model accuracy yields a weaker personalization result. 3) A model trained using a standard datacenter optimization method is much harder to personalize, compared to one trained using Federated Averaging, supporting the first claim. These results raise new questions for FL, MAML, and broader ML research.},

The widespread occurrence of electron holes in numerical simulations, space-craft observations, and laboratory experiments is illustrated. The elementary underlying theory is developed of a one-dimensional electron hole as a localized potential maximum, self-consistently sustained by a deficit of trapped electron phase-space density. The spatial extent of a hole is typically a few Debye lengths; what determines the minimum and maximum possible lengths is explained, addressing the key aspects of the as yet unsettled dispute between the integral and differential approaches to hole structure. In multiple dimensions, holes tend to form less readily; they generally require a magnetic field and distribution-function anisotropy. The mechanisms by which they break up are explained, noting that this transverse instability is not fully understood. Examples are given of plasma circumstances where holes play an important role, and of recent progress on understanding their holistic kinematics and self-acceleration.},

	abstract = {Time domain structures (TDS) (electrostatic or electromagnetic electron holes, solitary waves, double layers, etc.) are ≥1 ms pulses having significant parallel (to the background magnetic field) electric fields. They are abundant through space and occur in packets of hundreds in the outer Van Allen radiation belts where they produce magnetic-field-aligned electron pitch angle distributions at energies up to a hundred keV. TDS can provide the seed electrons that are later accelerated to relativistic energies by whistlers and they also produce field-aligned electrons that may be responsible for some types of auroras. These field-aligned electron distributions result from at least three processes. The first process is parallel acceleration by Landau trapping in the TDS parallel electric field. The second process is Fermi acceleration due to reflection of electrons by the TDS. The third process is an effective and rapid pitch angle scattering resulting from electron interactions with the perpendicular and parallel electric and magnetic fields of many TDS. TDS are created by current-driven and beam-related instabilities and by whistler-related processes such as parametric decay of whistlers and nonlinear evolution from oblique whistlers. New results on the temporal relationship of TDS and particle injections, types of field-aligned electron pitch angle distributions produced by TDS, the mechanisms for generation of field-aligned distributions by TDS, the maximum energies of field-aligned electrons created by TDS in the absence of whistler mode waves, TDS generation by oblique whistlers and three-wave-parametric decay, and the correlation between TDS and auroral particle precipitation, are presented.},

We study the electrostatic waves and electron heating observed over the lunar magnetic anomalies by analyzing data from the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft. Based on the analysis of two lunar flybys in 2011 and 2013, we find that the electron twostream instability (ETSI) and electron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) may play an important role in driving the electrostatic waves. We also find that ECDI, along with the modified two-stream instability (MTSI), may provide the mechanisms responsible for substantial isotropic electron heating over the lunar magnetic anomalies.},

Large-aspect-ratio Sweet-Parker current sheets are shown to be unstable to super-Alfvenically fast formation of plasmoid (magnetic-island) chains. The plasmoid number scales as S3/8 and the instability growth rate in the linear stage as S1/4, in agreement with the theory by Loureiro et al. [Phys. Plasmas 14, 100703 (2007)]. In the nonlinear regime, plasmoids continue to grow faster than they are ejected and completely disrupt the reconnection layer. These results suggest that high-Lundquist-number reconnection is inherently time-dependent and hence call for a substantial revision of the standard Sweet-Parker quasistationary picture for S{\textgreater}104.},

	abstract = {Intense lower band chorus waves are ubiquitous in the inner magnetosphere. Their properties have been modeled by various codes and investigated using measurements of many spacecraft missions. This study aims to compare simulated and observed properties of chorus waves. We present detailed comparisons between results from four different codes of nonlinear chorus wave generation and statistical observations from satellites, focusing on the fine structure of such chorus waves. We show that simulations performed with these different codes well reproduce the observed wave packet characteristics, although in somewhat complementary parameter domains as concerns wave packets sizes, amplitudes, and frequency sweep rates. In particular, simulations generate both the frequently observed short wave packets with high positive and negative frequency sweep rates, and the more rare long and intense packets with mainly rising tones. Moreover, simulations reproduce quantitatively both the increase of the size of the observed chorus wave packets with their peak amplitude, and the fast decrease of their frequency sweep rate as their size increases. This confirms the reliability of the main existing codes for accurately modeling chorus wave generation, although we find that initial conditions should be carefully selected to reproduce a given parameter range.},

The integrator is based on a Gauß–Radau quadrature and can handle conservative as well as non-conservative forces. We develop a step-size control that can automatically choose an optimal timestep. The algorithm can handle close encounters and high-eccentricity orbits. The systematic errors are kept well below machine precision, and long-term orbit integrations over 109 orbits show that ias15 is optimal in the sense that it follows Brouwer's law, i.e. the energy error behaves like a random walk. Our tests show that ias15 is superior to a mixed-variable symplectic integrator and other popular integrators, including high-order ones, in both speed and accuracy. In fact, ias15 preserves the symplecticity of Hamiltonian systems better than the commonly used nominally symplectic integrators to which we compared it. We provide an open-source implementation of ias15. The package comes with several easy-to-extend examples involving resonant planetary systems, Kozai–Lidov cycles, close encounters, radiation pressure, quadrupole moment and generic damping functions that can, among other things, be used to simulate planet–disc interactions. Other non-conservative forces can be added easily.},

This allows one to understand (oriented, closed) 1- and 2-dimensional TQFTs in terms of a finite amount of algebraic data, while already the 3-dimensional case needs an infinite amount of data. We evade these complications by instead discussing some aspects of 3-dimensional extended TQFTs, and their relation to braided monoidal categories.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN has 10.6\% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code in modern libraries.},

	abstract = {The Weibel instability driven by two symmetric counterstreaming relativistic electron plasmas, also referred to as current-filamentation instability, is studied in a constant and uniform external magnetic field aligned with the plasma flows. Both the linear and nonlinear stages of the instability are investigated using analytical modeling and particle-in-cell simulations. While previous studies have already described the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field, we show here that the saturation stage is only weakly affected. The different mechanisms responsible for the saturation are discussed in detail in the relativistic cold fluid framework considering a single unstable mode. The application of an external field leads to a slight increase of the saturation level for large wavelengths, while it does not affect the small wavelengths. Multimode and temperature effects are then investigated. While at high temperature the saturation level is independent of the external magnetic field, at low but finite temperature the competition between different modes in the presence of an external magnetic field leads to a saturation level lower with respect to the unmagnetized case.},

	abstract = {In the study of human learning, there is broad evidence that our ability to retain information improves with repeated exposure and decays with delay since last exposure. This plays a crucial role in the design of educational software, leading to a trade-oﬀ between teaching new material and reviewing what has already been taught. A common way to balance this trade-oﬀ is spaced repetition, which uses periodic review of content to improve long-term retention. Though spaced repetition is widely used in practice, e.g., in electronic ﬂashcard software, there is little formal understanding of the design of these systems. Our paper addresses this gap in three ways. First, we mine log data from spaced repetition software to establish the functional dependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, we use this memory model to develop a stochastic model for spaced repetition systems. We propose a queueing network model of the Leitner system for reviewing ﬂashcards, along with a heuristic approximation that admits a tractable optimization problem for review scheduling. Finally, we empirically evaluate our queueing model through a Mechanical Turk experiment, verifying a key qualitative prediction of our model: the existence of a sharp phase transition in learning outcomes upon increasing the rate of new item introductions.},

Spark gaps are thought to drive particle acceleration and pair creation in the black-hole magnetosphere. In this Letter, we perform 2D axisymmetric general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of a monopole black-hole magnetosphere with a realistic treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production. We find that the magnetosphere can self-consistently fill itself with plasma and activate the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. A highly time-dependent spark gap opens near the inner light surface, which injects pair plasma into the magnetosphere. These results may account for the high-energy activity observed in active galactic nuclei and explain the origin of plasma at the base of the jet.},

	abstract = {Accreting neutron stars can power a wide range of astrophysical phenomena including short- and long-duration gamma-ray bursts, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, and X-ray binaries. Numerical simulations are a valuable tool for studying the accretion-disk–magnetosphere interaction that is central to these problems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond pulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating accretion, have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while force-free methods, suitable for such regions, cannot include the accreting gas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free, highly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic simulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric general-relativistic MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the interaction of a turbulent accretion flow with a pulsar’s electromagnetic wind can lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state. This transition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose power can greatly exceed the power of the isolated pulsar’s wind. If the accretion rate is below a critical value, the pulsar instead expels the accretion stream. More generally, our simulations produce for the first time the four possible accretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion rate: (a) crushed magnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled accretion onto the stellar poles; (c) the propeller state, where material enters through the light cylinder but is prevented from accreting by the centrifugal barrier; (d) almost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the light cylinder by the pulsar wind.},

However, the scale and heterogeneity of federated data presents new challenges in research areas such as federated learning, meta-learning, and multi-task learning. As the machine learning community begins to tackle these challenges, we are at a critical time to ensure that developments made in these areas are grounded with realistic benchmarks. To this end, we propose LEAF, a modular benchmarking framework for learning in federated settings.

	abstract = {Federated Learning is a distributed learning paradigm with two key challenges that differentiate it from traditional distributed optimization: (1) significant variability in terms of the systems characteristics on each device in the network (systems heterogeneity), and (2) non-identically distributed data across the network (statistical heterogeneity). In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, FedProx demonstrates significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to FedAvg---improving absolute test accuracy by 22\% on average.},

The novelty in our work is that our runtime analysis considers random straggler delays, which helps us design and compare distributed SGD algorithms that strike a balance between stragglers and staleness.

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive overview of numerical hydrodynamics and magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) in general relativity. Some significant additions have been incorporated with respect to the previous two versions of this review (2000, 2003), most notably the coverage of general-relativistic MHD, a field in which remarkable activity and progress has occurred in the last few years. Correspondingly, the discussion of astrophysical simulations in general-relativistic hydrodynamics is enlarged to account for recent relevant advances, while those dealing with general-relativistic MHD are amply covered in this review for the first time. The basic outline of this article is nevertheless similar to its earlier versions, save for the addition of MHD-related issues throughout. Hence, different formulations of both the hydrodynamics and MHD equations are presented, with special mention of conservative and hyperbolic formulations well adapted to advanced numerical methods. A large sample of numerical approaches for solving such hyperbolic systems of equations is discussed, paying particular attention to solution procedures based on schemes exploiting the characteristic structure of the equations through linearized Riemann solvers. As previously stated, a comprehensive summary of astrophysical simulations in strong gravitational fields is also presented. These are detailed in three basic sections, namely gravitational collapse, black-hole accretion, and neutron-star evolutions; despite the boundaries, these sections may (and in fact do) overlap throughout the discussion. The material contained in these sections highlights the numerical challenges of various representative simulations. It also follows, to some extent, the chronological development of the field, concerning advances in the formulation of the gravitational field, hydrodynamics and MHD equations and the numerical methodology designed to solve them. To keep the length of this article reasonable, an effort has been made to focus on multidimensional studies, directing the interested reader to earlier versions of the review for discussions on one-dimensional works.},

	abstract = {The recent discovery of an Earth-sized planet (TOI-700 d) in the habitable zone of an early-type M-dwarf by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite constitutes an important advance. In this Letter, we assess the feasibility of this planet to retain an atmosphere—one of the chief ingredients for surface habitability—over long timescales by employing state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamic models to simulate the stellar wind and the associated rates of atmospheric escape. We take two major factors into consideration, namely, the planetary atmospheric composition and magnetic field. In all cases, we determine that the atmospheric ion escape rates are potentially a few orders of magnitude higher than the inner solar system planets, but TOI-700 d is nevertheless capable of retaining a 1 bar atmosphere over gigayear timescales for certain regions of the parameter space. The simulations show that the unmagnetized TOI-700 d with a 1 bar Earth-like atmosphere could be stripped away rather quickly ({\textless}1 gigayear), while the unmagnetized TOI-700 d with a 1 bar CO2-dominated atmosphere could persist for many billions of years; we find that the magnetized Earth-like case falls in between these two scenarios. We also discuss the prospects for detecting radio emission of the planet (thereby constraining its magnetic field) and discerning the presence of an atmosphere.},

This novel fluid model incorporates the nonideal effects including the Hall effect, electron inertia, and tensorial pressures that are critical for collisionless magnetic reconnection; therefore, it is particularly well suited for investigating collisionless magnetic reconnection in Mercury's magnetotail and at the planet's magnetopause. The model is able to reproduce the observed magnetic field vectors, field-aligned currents, and cross-tail current sheet asymmetry (beyond magnetohydrodynamic approach), and the simulation results are in good agreement with spacecraft observations. We also study the magnetospheric response of Mercury to a hypothetical extreme event with an enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure, which demonstrates the significance of induction effects resulting from the electromagnetically coupled interior. More interestingly, plasmoids (or flux ropes) are formed in Mercury's magnetotail during the event, indicating the highly dynamic nature of Mercury's magnetosphere.},

In this Letter, we study the role of the plasmoid instability in two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence by means of high-resolution direct numerical simulations. At a sufficiently large magnetic Reynolds number (Rm=106), the combined effects of dynamic alignment and turbulent intermittency lead to a copious formation of plasmoids in a multitude of intense current sheets. The disruption of current sheet structures facilitates the energy cascade towards small scales, leading to the breaking and steepening of the energy spectrum. In the plasmoid-mediated regime, the energy spectrum displays a scaling that is close to the spectral index −2.2 as proposed by recent analytic theories. We also demonstrate that the scale-dependent dynamic alignment exists in 2D MHD turbulence and the corresponding slope of the alignment angle is close to 0.25.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas. It is motivated by observations of electromagnetic and density fluctuations in the solar wind, interstellar medium and galaxy clusters, as well as by models of particle heating in accretion disks. All of these plasmas and many others have turbulent motions at weakly collisional and collisionless scales. The paper focuses on turbulence in a strong mean magnetic field. The key assumptions are that the turbulent fluctuations are small compared to the mean field, spatially anisotropic with respect to it and that their frequency is low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The turbulence is assumed to be forced at some system-specific outer scale. The energy injected at this scale has to be dissipated into heat, which ultimately cannot be accomplished without collisions. A kinetic cascade develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. The nature of the kinetic cascade in various scale ranges depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations that exist there. There are four special scales that separate physically distinct regimes: the electron and ion gyroscales, the mean free path and the electron diffusion scale. In each of the scale ranges separated by these scales, the fully kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more physically transparent and computationally tractable system of equations, which are derived in a rigorous way. In the “inertial range” above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade separates into two parts: a cascade of Alfvénic fluctuations and a passive cascade of density and magnetic-field-strength fluctuations. The former are governed by the reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales; the latter obey a linear kinetic equation along the (moving) field lines associated with the Alfvénic component (in the collisional limit, these compressive fluctuations become the slow and entropy modes of the conventional MHD). In the “dissipation range” below ion gyroscale, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfvén-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like electron reduced magnetohydrodynamic (ERMHD) equations and a passive cascade of ion entropy fluctuations both in space and velocity. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was Landau-damped at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for all of these cascades. The relationship between the theoretical models proposed in this paper and astrophysical applications and observations is discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the turbulent cascade of magnetic energy in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas. A cascade model is presented, based on the assumptions of local nonlinear energy transfer in wave number space, critical balance between linear propagation and nonlinear interaction times, and the applicability of linear dissipation rates for the nonlinearly turbulent plasma. The model follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the driving scale in the MHD regime, through the transition at the ion Larmor radius into the kinetic Alfvén wave regime, in which the turbulence is dissipated by kinetic processes. The turbulent fluctuations remain at frequencies below the ion cyclotron frequency due to the strong anisotropy of the turbulent fluctuations, k∥ ≪ k⊥ (implied by critical balance). In this limit, the turbulence is optimally described by gyrokinetics; it is shown that the gyrokinetic approximation is well satisfied for typical slow solar wind parameters. Wave phase velocity measurements are consistent with a kinetic Alfvén wave cascade and not the onset of ion cyclotron damping. The conditions under which the gyrokinetic cascade reaches the ion cyclotron frequency are established. Cascade model solutions imply that collisionless damping provides a natural explanation for the observed range of spectral indices in the dissipation range of the solar wind. The dissipation range spectrum is predicted to be an exponential fall off; the power-law behavior apparent in observations may be an artifact of limited instrumental sensitivity. The cascade model is motivated by a program of gyrokinetic simulations of turbulence and particle heating in the solar wind.},

The TF (i) increases the size of E∥ above that implied by the electron pressure divergence; (ii) deepens the electrostatic trap for electrons about the Sun; (iii) strengthens the electron kurtosis and skewness, further levitating ions out of their gravitational well, (iv) constrains the heat flow in a plasma where parallel currents are preempted; and (v) is shown to be directly measurable using the full electron velocity distribution function above and below thermal energies. (vi) The usually ignored TF modifies all species internal energy equations; it enhances the rate of conduction cooling by the electrons, increases the ion entropy, and forestalls adiabatic behavior. Using estimates at 1 au this effect is especially strong in the higher speed wind U {\textgreater} 400 km s−1 regime. (vii) On rather general grounds any physical heat transport is accompanied by an underlying TF; in almost all known cases of modeling astrophysical plasmas this dependence is ignored or demonstrably incorrect.

	abstract = {Fairness and robustness are two important concerns for federated learning systems. In this work, we identify that robustness to data and model poisoning attacks and fairness, measured as the uniformity of performance across devices, are competing constraints in statistically heterogeneous networks. To address these constraints, we propose employing a simple, general framework for personalized federated learning, Ditto, that can inherently provide fairness and robustness benefits, and develop a scalable solver for it. Theoretically, we analyze the ability of Ditto to achieve fairness and robustness simultaneously on a class of linear problems. Empirically, across a suite of federated datasets, we show that Ditto not only achieves competitive performance relative to recent personalization methods, but also enables more accurate, robust, and fair models relative to state-of-the-art fair or robust baselines.},

However, in spite of recent research efforts, its performance is not fully understood. We obtain tight convergence rates for FedAvg and prove that it suffers from 'client-drift' when the data is heterogeneous (non-iid), resulting in unstable and slow convergence. As a solution, we propose a new algorithm (SCAFFOLD) which uses control variates (variance reduction) to correct for the `client-drift' in its local updates. We prove that SCAFFOLD requires significantly fewer communication rounds and is not affected by data heterogeneity or client sampling. Further, we show that (for quadratics) SCAFFOLD can take advantage of similarity in the client's data yielding even faster convergence. The latter is the first result to quantify the usefulness of local-steps in distributed optimization.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2944},
	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

	abstract = {Variance reduction has emerged in recent years as a strong competitor to stochastic gradient descent in non-convex problems, providing the first algorithms to improve upon the converge rate of stochastic gradient descent for finding first-order critical points. However, variance reduction techniques typically require carefully tuned learning rates and willingness to use excessively large "mega-batches" in order to achieve their improved results. We present a new algorithm, STORM, that does not require any batches and makes use of adaptive learning rates, enabling simpler implementation and less hyperparameter tuning. Our technique for removing the batches uses a variant of momentum to achieve variance reduction in non-convex optimization. On smooth losses \$F\$, STORM finds a point \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\}\$ with \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\}[{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}nabla F({\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{x\}){\textbackslash}{\textbar}]{\textbackslash}le O(1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\}+{\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}/T{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\})\$ in \$T\$ iterations with \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\$ variance in the gradients, matching the optimal rate but without requiring knowledge of \${\textbackslash}sigma\$.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a challenging setting for optimization due to the heterogeneity of the data across different clients which gives rise to the client drift phenomenon. In fact, obtaining an algorithm for FL which is uniformly better than simple centralized training has been a major open problem thus far. In this work, we propose a general algorithmic framework, Mime, which i) mitigates client drift and ii) adapts arbitrary centralized optimization algorithms such as momentum and Adam to the cross-device federated learning setting. Mime uses a combination of control-variates and server-level statistics (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each local update mimics that of the centralized method run on iid data. We prove a reduction result showing that Mime can translate the convergence of a generic algorithm in the centralized setting into convergence in the federated setting. Further, we show that when combined with momentum based variance reduction, Mime is provably faster than any centralized method--the first such result. We also perform a thorough experimental exploration of Mime's performance on real world datasets.},

These protons with a higher ring speed can further excite MS waves at a lower frequency. As a result, a new “double ring” distribution is found to be formed through scattering of higher energy protons by the lower frequency MS waves.

Termed `moss' for its spongy, low-lying, appearance, observations and modeling imply that the phenomenon is caused by thermal conduction from 3–5 MKcoronal loops overlying the plage: moss is the upper transition region emission of hot coronal loops. The spongy appearance is due to the presence of chromospheric jets or `spicules' interspersed with the EUV emission elements. High cadence TRACE observations show that the moss EUV elements interact with the chromospheric jets on 10 s time scales. The location of EUV emission in the moss does not correlate well to the locations of underlying magnetic elements in the chromosphere and photosphere, implying a complex magnetic topology for coronal loop footpoint regions.

	abstract = {We gave an extensive study for the quasi-periodic perturbations on the time profiles of the line of sight (LOS) magnetic field in 10 × 10 sub-areas in a solar plage region (corresponds to a facula on the photosphere). The perturbations are found to be associated with the enhancement of He I 10830 Å absorption in a moss region, which is connected to loops with million-degree plasma. FFT analysis to the perturbations gives a kind of spectrum similar to that of Doppler velocity: a number of discrete periods around 5 minutes. The amplitudes of the magnetic perturbations are found to be proportional to magnetic field strength over these sub-areas. In addition, magnetic perturbations lag behind a quarter of the cycle in the phase with respect to the p-mode Doppler velocity. We show that the relationships can be well explained with an MHD solution for the magneto-acoustic oscillations in high-β plasma. Observational analysis also shows that, for the two regions with the stronger and weaker magnetic field, the perturbations are always anti-phased. All findings show that the magnetic perturbations are actually magneto-acoustic oscillations on the solar surface, the photosphere, powered by p-mode oscillations. The findings may provide a new diagnostic tool for exploring the relationship between magneto-acoustic oscillations and the heating of the solar upper atmosphere, as well as their role in helioseismology.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which a large number of clients coordinate with a central server to learn a model without sharing their own training data. Standard federated optimization methods such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) are often difficult to tune and exhibit unfavorable convergence behavior. In non-federated settings, adaptive optimization methods have had notable success in combating such issues. In this work, we propose federated versions of adaptive optimizers, including Adagrad, Adam, and Yogi, and analyze their convergence in the presence of heterogeneous data for general non-convex settings. Our results highlight the interplay between client heterogeneity and communication efficiency. We also perform extensive experiments on these methods and show that the use of adaptive optimizers can significantly improve the performance of federated learning.},

	abstract = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a versatile tool for solving a wide range of constrained optimization problems, with differentiable or non-differentiable objective functions. Unfortunately, its performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, which makes ADMM often unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method to adaptively tune the penalty parameters to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference is now widely established as one of the principal foundations for machine learning. In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES ('Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS') which allows models to be specified graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.},

These long-term measurements at low-Earth orbit (LEO) showed clear solar cycle variations which anticorrelate with sunspot number. However, the magnitude of the variation is much greater than the solar cycle variation of galactic cosmic rays ({\textgreater}GeV) that are regarded as a source of these trapped protons. Furthermore, the proton fluxes and their variations sensitively depend on the altitude above the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. With respect to protons ({\textgreater}36 MeV) mirroring near the magnetic equator, both POES measurements and simulations show no obvious solar cycle variations at L {\textgreater} 1.2. This is also confirmed by recent measurements from the Van Allen Probes (2012–2019), but there are clear solar cycle variations and a strong spatial gradient of the proton flux below L = 1.2. A direct comparison between measurements and simulations leads to the conclusion that energy loss of trapped protons due to collisions with free and bound electrons in the ionosphere and atmosphere is the dominant mechanism for the strong spatial gradient and solar cycle variation of the inner belt protons. This fact is also key of importance for spacecraft and instrument design and operation in near-Earth space.},

The solar proton source dominates at L {\textgreater}1.5 and energies {\textless}100 MeV and the Cosmic Ray Albedo Neutron Decay (CRAND) source, dominates otherwise. The inward diffusion of 10 s of MeV solar protons to L {\textless}2 adds to and merges with the preexisting trapped protons in the inner belt. Van Allen Probes have not measured any 2 MeV electron enhancements inside L 2.6 for the past six years. However, penetrations of such energetic electrons into L {\textless}2.6 were measured previously during periods of stronger solar wind conditions in terms of solar wind speed, interplanetary magnetic field magnitude, and southward Bz. Similarly, very few {\textgreater}1 MeV electrons have been measured at L {\textless}2, based on the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) on the Van Allen Probes, while AE8 and AE9 models, which were developed based on older data, show plenty of {\textgreater}1 MeV electrons at L {\textless}2. These differences question whether Van Allen Probes measurements are representative of the dynamics of MeV electrons during previous solar cycles or whether previous electron measurements in the inner belt have been accurate.},

It plays a major role in the sculpting of the asteroid belt and in the diffusion of comets from the outer region of the solar system. All the inner planets probably experienced large scale chaotic behavior for their obliquities during their history. The Earth obliquity is presently stable only because of the presence of the Moon, and the tilt of Mars undergoes large chaotic variations from 0° to about 60°. On billion years time scale, the orbits of the planets themselves present strong chaotic variations which can lead to the escape of Mercury or collision with Venus in less than 3.5 Gyr. The organization of the planets in the solar system thus seems to be strongly related to this chaotic evolution, reaching at all time a state of marginal stability, that is practical stability on a time-scale comparable to its age.},

We derive growth timescales for a simple two-orbit model using a Gauss N-ring code, and generalize our result to larger N systems with N-body simulations. We find that two-body relaxation slows the growth of the instability at low N and that angular phase coverage of orbits in the disk is important at higher N. As N{\textbackslash}to ∞ , the e-folding timescale converges to that expected from secular theory.},

In this Letter, we present N-body simulations of the long-term behavior of such a system, finding apsidal clustering of the orbits in the disk plane. The timescale over which the clustering is maintained increases with number of particles, suggesting that lopsided configurations are stable at large N. This discovery may explain the observed apsidal (ϖ) clustering of extreme trans-Neptunian Objects in the outer solar system.},

	abstract = {Whistler mode chorus waves are quasi-coherent electromagnetic emissions with frequency chirping. Various models have been proposed to understand the chirping mechanism, which is a long-standing problem in space plasmas. Based on analysis of effective wave growth rate and electron phase space dynamics in a self-consistent particle simulation, we propose a phenomenological model called the “Trap-Release-Amplify” (TaRA) model for chorus. In this model, phase space structures of correlated electrons are formed by nonlinear wave particle interactions, which mainly occur in the downstream of equator. When released from the wave packet in the upstream, these electrons lead to selective amplification of new emissions which satisfy the phase-locking condition to maximize wave power transfer, resulting in frequency chirping. The phase-locking condition at the release point gives a chirping rate that is, fully consistent with the one by Helliwell in case of a nonuniform background magnetic field. The nonlinear wave particle interaction part of the TaRA model results in a chirping rate that is, proportional to wave amplitude, a conclusion originally reached by Vomvoridis et al. Therefore, the TaRA model unifies two different results from seemingly unrelated studies. Furthermore, the TaRA model naturally explains fine structures of chorus waves, including subpackets and bandwidth, and their evolution through dynamics of phase-trapped electrons. Finally, we suggest that this model could be applied to explain other related phenomena, including frequency chirping of chorus in a uniform background magnetic field and of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves in the magnetosphere.},

	abstract = {We propose a self-consistent theoretical framework of chorus wave excitation, which describes the evolution of the whistler fluctuation spectrum as well as the supra-thermal electron distribution function. The renormalized hot electron response is cast in the form of a Dyson-like equation, which is then manipulated to obtain evolution equations for nonlinear fluctuation growth and frequency shift. This approach allows us to analytically derive for the first time the well-known result for the chorus chirping rate originally proposed by Vomvoridis et al., 1982. Chorus chirping is shown to correspond to maximization of wave particle power exchange, where each individual wave belonging to the whistler wave packet is characterized by small nonlinear frequency shift. We also show that different interpretations of chorus chirping proposed in published literature have a consistent collocation within the present theoretical framework, which further illuminates the analogy with similar phenomena in fusion plasmas and free electron laser physics.},

	abstract = {Observations of solar wind electron distribution functions (VDFs) reveal considerable deviations from a simple Maxwellian VDF. A thermal core and a suprathermal halo and antisunward, magnetic field-aligned beam, or "strahl," can be distinguished. At higher energies above 2 keV, a superhalo can even be observed. A kinetic description of electrons in the solar corona and wind, including resonant interaction between electrons and whistler waves, can reproduce an enhancement of suprathermal electron fluxes compared to the core flux. The whistler waves are assumed to be generated below the solar coronal base and propagate through the corona into interplanetary space. However, the resonance condition with these whistlers can only be fulfilled by electrons that move sunward. For antisunward-moving electrons, such a model lacks an efficient diffusion mechanism. The mirror force due to the opening magnetic field geometry of a solar coronal hole and in the solar wind focuses the electrons into a very narrow beam. This expectation of an extremely narrow beam is contradicted by observations of a "strahl" that has a finite width, and of an quasi-isotropic superhalo component. Thus, a diffusion mechanism for antisunward-moving electrons must exist in interplanetary space. In this paper, antisunward-propagating whistler waves are introduced into the kinetic model in order to provide this diffusion. Their wave power is estimated as a small fraction of the total wave power that is measured in interplanetary space. The kinetic results show that the whistler waves are capable of influencing the solar wind electron VDFs significantly, leading to the formation of both the halo and strahl populations and a more isotropic distribution at higher energies, in good agreement with solar wind observations.},

In the high speed solar wind, a third population of ‘strahl’ electrons is generally observed. New collisional models based on the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation can be used to determine the importance of the different electron populations as a function of the radial distance. Typical electron velocity distribution functions observed at 1 AU from the Sun are used as boundary conditions for the high speed solar wind and for the low speed solar wind. Taking into account the effects of external forces and Coulomb collisions with a background plasma, suprathermal tails are found to be present in the electron VDF at low altitudes in the corona when they exist at large radial distances.},

	abstract = {Data from the first two orbits of the Sun by Parker Solar Probe reveal that the solar wind sunward of 50 solar radii is replete with plasma waves and instabilities. One of the most prominent plasma wave power enhancements in this region appears near the electron cyclotron frequency (fce). Most of this wave power is concentrated in electric field fluctuations near 0.7 fce and fce, with strong harmonics of both frequencies extending above fce. At least two distinct, often concurrent, wave modes are observed, preliminarily identified as electrostatic whistler-mode waves and electron Bernstein waves. Wave intervals range in duration from a few seconds to hours. Both the amplitudes and number of detections of these near-fce waves increase significantly with decreasing distance to the Sun, suggesting that they play an important role in the evolution of electron populations in the near-Sun solar wind. Correlations are found between the detection of these waves and properties of solar wind electron populations, including electron core drift, implying that these waves play a role in regulating the heat flux carried by solar wind electrons. Observation of these near-fce waves is found to be strongly correlated with near-radial solar wind magnetic field configurations with low levels of magnetic turbulence. A scenario for the growth of these waves is presented, which implies that regions of low-turbulence near-radial magnetic field are a prominent feature of the solar wind structure near the Sun.},

	abstract = {The Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) Investigation on Solar Probe Plus is a four sensor instrument suite that provides complete measurements of the electrons and ionized helium and hydrogen that constitute the bulk of solar wind and coronal plasma. SWEAP consists of the Solar Probe Cup (SPC) and the Solar Probe Analyzers (SPAN). SPC is a Faraday Cup that looks directly at the Sun and measures ion and electron fluxes and flow angles as a function of energy. SPAN consists of an ion and electron electrostatic analyzer (ESA) on the ram side of SPP (SPAN-A) and an electron ESA on the anti-ram side (SPAN-B). The SPAN-A ion ESA has a time of flight section that enables it to sort particles by their mass/charge ratio, permitting differentiation of ion species. SPAN-A and -B are rotated relative to one another so their broad fields of view combine like the seams on a baseball to view the entire sky except for the region obscured by the heat shield and covered by SPC. Observations by SPC and SPAN produce the combined field of view and measurement capabilities required to fulfill the science objectives of SWEAP and Solar Probe Plus. SWEAP measurements, in concert with magnetic and electric fields, energetic particles, and white light contextual imaging will enable discovery and understanding of solar wind acceleration and formation, coronal and solar wind heating, and particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere of the solar system. SPC and SPAN are managed by the SWEAP Electronics Module (SWEM), which distributes power, formats onboard data products, and serves as a single electrical interface to the spacecraft. SWEAP data products include ion and electron velocity distribution functions with high energy and angular resolution. Full resolution data are stored within the SWEM, enabling high resolution observations of structures such as shocks, reconnection events, and other transient structures to be selected for download after the fact. This paper describes the implementation of the SWEAP Investigation, the driving requirements for the suite, expected performance of the instruments, and planned data products, as of mission preliminary design review.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO), a complement of multi-spacecraft missions and ground-based observatories to study the space environment, data retrieval, analysis, and visualization of space physics data can be daunting. The Space Physics Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), a grass-roots software development platform (www.spedas.org), is now officially supported by NASA Heliophysics as part of its data environment infrastructure. It serves more than a dozen space missions and ground observatories and can integrate the full complement of past and upcoming space physics missions with minimal resources, following clear, simple, and well-proven guidelines. Free, modular and configurable to the needs of individual missions, it works in both command-line (ideal for experienced users) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode (reducing the learning curve for first-time users). Both options have “crib-sheets,” user-command sequences in ASCII format that can facilitate record-and-repeat actions, especially for complex operations and plotting. Crib-sheets enhance scientific interactions, as users can move rapidly and accurately from exchanges of technical information on data processing to efficient discussions regarding data interpretation and science. SPEDAS can readily query and ingest all International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP)-compatible products from the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF), enabling access to a vast collection of historic and current mission data. The planned incorporation of Heliophysics Application Programmer’s Interface (HAPI) standards will facilitate data ingestion from distributed datasets that adhere to these standards. Although SPEDAS is currently Interactive Data Language (IDL)-based (and interfaces to Java-based tools such as Autoplot), efforts are under-way to expand it further to work with python (first as an interface tool and potentially even receiving an under-the-hood replacement). We review the SPEDAS development history, goals, and current implementation. We explain its “modes of use” with examples geared for users and outline its technical implementation and requirements with software developers in mind. We also describe SPEDAS personnel and software management, interfaces with other organizations, resources and support structure available to the community, and future development plans.},

	abstract = {The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the magnetospheric boundary plays a crucial role in solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, particle entry, and energization. The full extent of its impact has remained an open question due, in part, to global models without sufficient resolution to capture waves at higher latitudes. Using global magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate an event when the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission observed periodic low-frequency waves at the dawn-flank, high-latitude boundary layer. We show the layer to be unstable, even though the slow solar wind with the draped interplanetary magnetic field is seemingly unfavorable for wave generation. The simulated velocity shear at the boundary is thin () and requires commensurately high spatial resolution. These results, together with MMS observations, confirm for the first time in fully three-dimensional global geometry that KH waves can grow in this region and thus can be an important process for energetic particle acceleration, dynamics, and transport.},

	abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

	abstract = {Axisymmetric disks of high-eccentricity, low-mass bodies on near-Keplerian orbits are unstable to an out-of-plane buckling. This "inclination instability" exponentially grows the orbital inclinations, raises perihelion distances, and clusters in the argument of perihelion. Here we examine the instability in a massive primordial scattered disk including the orbit-averaged gravitational influence of the giant planets. We show that differential apsidal precession induced by the giant planets will suppress the inclination instability unless the primordial mass is ≳20 Earth masses. We also show that the instability should produce a "perihelion gap" at semimajor axes of hundreds of astronomical units, as the orbits of the remnant population are more likely to have extremely large perihelion distances ( \$\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal O \}(100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{au\})\$ ) than intermediate values.},

	abstract = {Discs of bodies orbiting a much more massive central object are extremely common in astrophysics. When the orbits comprising such discs are eccentric, we show they are susceptible to a new dynamical instability. Gravitational forces between bodies in the disc drive exponential growth of their orbital inclinations and clustering in their angles of pericentre, expanding an initially thin disc into a conical shape by giving each orbit an identical `tilt' with respect to the disc plane. This new instability dynamically produces the unusual distribution of orbits observed for minor planets beyond Neptune, suggesting that the instability has shaped the outer Solar system. It also implies a large disc mass (∼ 1-10 Earth masses) of scattered bodies at hundreds of AU; we predict increasing numbers of detections of minor planets clustered in their angles of pericentre with high inclinations.},

	abstract = {We investigate the solar wind interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere by using a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation driven by an idealized time-varying solar wind input that includes features of Corotating Interaction Regions typically seen at Saturn. Our model results indicate that the compressibility of Saturn's magnetosphere is intermediate between the Earth's and Jupiter's, and the magnetopause location appears insensitive to the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field. The modeled dependences of both the magnetopause and bow shock locations on the solar wind dynamic pressure agree reasonably well with those of data-based empirical models. Our model shows that the centrifugal acceleration of mass-loaded flux tubes leads to reconnection on closed field lines forming plasmoids, an intrinsic process (“Vasyliūnas-cycle”) in Saturn's magnetosphere taking place independent of the external conditions. In addition, another type of reconnection process involving open flux tubes (“Dungey-cycle”) is also seen in our simulation when the external condition is favorable for dayside reconnection. Under such circumstances, plasmoid formation in the tail involves reconnection between open field lines in the lobes, producing stronger global impacts on the magnetosphere and ionosphere compared to that imposed by the Vasyliūnas-cycle directly. Our model also shows that large-scale tail reconnection may be induced by compressions driven by interplanetary shocks. In our simulation, large-scale tail reconnection and plasmoid formation take place in a quasi-periodic manner but the recurrence rate tends to be higher as the dynamic pressure becomes higher. While large-scale plasmoid release clearly is an important process in controlling the magnetospheric dynamics, it appears insufficient to account for all the losses of plasma added by the magnetospheric sources. We find that a large fraction of the planetary plasma is lost through the magnetotail near the flanks probably through relatively small-scale plasmoids, a situation that may also exist at Jupiter.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of magnetic field, plasma flow and energetic electron anisotropies in the magnetotail plasma sheet during substorms have provided strong support for the idea that a magnetospheric substorm involves the formation of a magnetic neutral line (the substorm neutral line) within the plasma sheet at XSM ≈ — 10RE to -25RE. An initial effect, in the tail, of the neutral line's formation is the severance of plasma sheet field lines to form a plasmoid, i.e., a closed magnetic loop structure, that is quickly (within 5–10 min) ejected from the tail into the downstream solar wind. The plasmoid's escape leaves a thin downstream plasma sheet through which plasma and energetic particles stream continuously into the solar wind, often throughout the duration of the substorm's expansive phase. Southward oriented magnetic field threads this tailward-flowing plasma but its detection, as an identifier of the occurrence of magnetic reconnection, is made difficult by the thinness and turbulence of the downstream plasma sheet. The thinning of the plasma sheet downstream of the neutral line is observed, by satellites located anywhere but very close to the tail's midplane, as a plasma dropout. Multiple satellite observations of plasma droputs suggest that the substorm neutral line often extends across a large fraction ({\textgreater}\$\${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\$\$) of the tail's breadth. Near the time of substorm recovery the substorm neutral line moves quickly tailward to a more distant location, progressively inflating the closed field lines earthward of it, to reform the plasma sheet.},

	abstract = {A systems science examination of the Earth’s fully interconnected dynamic magnetosphere is presented. Here the magnetospheric system (a.k.a. the magnetosphere–ionosphere–thermosphere system) is considered to be comprised of 14 interconnected subsystems, where each subsystem is a characteristic particle population: 12 of those particle populations are plasmas and two (the atmosphere and the hydrogen geocorona) are neutrals. For the magnetospheric system, an assessment is made of the applicability of several system descriptors, such as adaptive, nonlinear, dissipative, interdependent, open, irreversible, and complex. The 14 subsystems of the magnetospheric system are cataloged and described, and the various types of magnetospheric waves that couple the behaviors of the subsystems to each other are explained. This yields a roadmap of the connectivity of the magnetospheric system. Various forms of magnetospheric activity beyond geomagnetic activity are reviewed, and four examples of emergent phenomena in the Earth’s magnetosphere are presented. Prior systems science investigations of the solar-wind-driven magnetospheric system are discussed: up to the present these investigations have not accounted for the full interconnectedness of the system. This overview and assessment of the Earth’s magnetosphere hopes to facilitate (1) future global systems science studies that involve the entire interconnected magnetospheric system with its diverse time and spatial scales and (2) connections of magnetospheric systems science with the broader Earth systems science.},

	abstract = {Magnetic reconnection, the merging of oppositely directed magnetic fields that leads to field reconfiguration, plasma heating, jetting and acceleration, is one of the most celebrated processes in collisionless plasmas. It requires the violation of the frozen-in condition which ties gyrating charged particles to the magnetic field inhibiting diffusion. Ongoing reconnection has been identified in near-Earth space as being responsible for the excitation of substorms, magnetic storms, generation of field aligned currents and their consequences, the wealth of auroral phenomena. Its theoretical understanding is now on the verge of being completed. Reconnection takes place in thin current sheets. Analytical concepts proceeded gradually down to the microscopic scale, the scale of the electron skin depth or inertial length, recognizing that current layers that thin do preferentially undergo spontaneous reconnection. Thick current layers start reconnecting when being forced by plasma inflow to thin. For almost half a century the physical mechanism of reconnection has remained a mystery. Spacecraft in situ observations in combination with sophisticated numerical simulations in two and three dimensions recently clarified the mist, finding that reconnection produces a specific structure of the current layer inside the electron inertial (also called electron diffusion) region around the reconnection site, the X line. Onset of reconnection is attributed to pseudo-viscous contributions of the electron pressure tensor aided by electron inertia and drag, creating a complicated structured electron current sheet, electric fields, and an electron exhaust extended along the current layer. We review the general background theory and recent developments in numerical simulation on collisionless reconnection. It is impossible to cover the entire field of reconnection in a short space-limited review. The presentation necessarily remains cursory, determined by our taste, preferences, and knowledge. Only a small amount of observations is included in order to support the few selected numerical simulations.},

MMS will, for the first time, be able to measure directly and with sufficient resolution key features of the magnetic reconnection process, down to the critical electron scales, which need to be resolved to understand how reconnection works. Owing to the complexity and extremely high spatial resolution required, no prior measurements exist, which could be employed to guide the definition of measurement requirements, and consequently set essential parameters for mission planning and execution. Insight into expected details of the reconnection process could hence only been obtained from theory and modern kinetic modeling. This situation was recognized early on by MMS leadership, which supported the formation of a fully integrated Theory and Modeling Team (TMT). The TMT participated in all aspects of mission planning, from the proposal stage to individual aspects of instrument performance characteristics. It provided and continues to provide to the mission the latest insights regarding the kinetic physics of magnetic reconnection, as well as associated particle acceleration and turbulence, assuring that, to the best of modern knowledge, the mission is prepared to resolve the inner workings of the magnetic reconnection process. The present paper provides a summary of key recent results or reconnection research by TMT members.},

	abstract = {This book provides an overview of recent research highlights in the main areas of application of magnetic reconnection (MR), including planetary, solar and magnetospheric physics and astrophysics. It describes how research on magnetic reconnection, especially concerning the Earth's magnetosphere, has grown extensively due to dedicated observations from major satellite missions such as Cluster, Double Star and Themis. The accumulated observations from these missions are being supplemented by many theoretical and modelling efforts, for which large scale computer facilities are successfully being used, and the theoretical advances are also covered in detail. Opening with an introductory discussion of some fundamental issues related to magnetic reconnection, subsequent chapters address topics including collisionless magnetic reconnection, MHD structures in 3D reconnection, energy conversion processes, fast reconnection mediated by plasmoids, rapid reconnection and magnetic field topology. Further chapters consider specific areas of application such as magnetospheric dayside and tail reconnection, comparative reconnection in planetary systems and reconnection in astrophysical systems. The book offers insight into discussions about fundamental concepts and key aspects of MR, access to the full set of applications of MR as presently known in space physics and in astrophysics, and an introduction to a new related area of study dealing with the annihilation of quantum magnetic fluxes and its implications in the study on neutron star activity. The book is aimed primarily at students entering the field, but will also serve as a useful reference text for established scientists and senior researchers},

	abstract = {While the particle-in-cell (PIC) method is quite mature, verification and validation of both newly developed methods and individual codes has largely focused on an idiosyncratic choice of a few test cases. Many of these test cases involve either one- or two-dimensional simulations. This is either due to availability of (quasi) analytic solutions or historical reasons. Additionally, tests often focus on investigation of particular physics problems, such as particle emission or collisions, and do not necessarily study the combined impact of the suite of algorithms necessary for a full featured PIC code. As three dimensional (3D) codes become the norm, there is a lack of benchmarks test that can establish the validity of these codes; existing papers either do not delve into the details of the numerical experiment or provide other measurable numeric metrics (such as noise) that are outcomes of the simulation. This paper seeks to provide several test cases that can be used for validation and bench-marking of particle in cell codes in 3D. We focus on examples that are collisionless, and can be run with a reasonable amount of computational power. Four test cases are presented in significant detail; these include, basic particle motion, beam expansion, adiabatic expansion of plasma, and two stream instability. All presented cases are compared either against existing analytical data or other codes. We anticipate that these cases should help fill the void of bench-marking and validation problems and help the development of new particle in cell codes.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized and privacy-preserving machine learning technique in which a group of clients collaborate with a server to learn a global model without sharing clients' data. One challenge associated with FL is statistical diversity among clients, which restricts the global model from delivering good performance on each client's task. To address this, we propose an algorithm for personalized FL (pFedMe) using Moreau envelopes as clients' regularized loss functions, which help decouple personalized model optimization from the global model learning in a bi-level problem stylized for personalized FL. Theoretically, we show that pFedMe's convergence rate is state-of-the-art: achieving quadratic speedup for strongly convex and sublinear speedup of order 2/3 for smooth nonconvex objectives. Experimentally, we verify that pFedMe excels at empirical performance compared with the vanilla FedAvg and Per-FedAvg, a meta-learning based personalized FL algorithm.},

Starting from basic linear theory, readers are first made comfortable with whistler wave packets and their propagation in slowly varying weakly non-uniform media, such as the Earth’s magnetosphere, where they can be amplified by a population of supra-thermal electrons. The nonlinear dynamic description of energetic electrons in the phase space in the presence of self-consistently evolving whistler fluctuation spectrum is progressively introduced by addressing renormalization of the electron response and spectrum evolution equations. Analytical and numerical results on chorus frequency chirping are obtained and compared with existing observations and particle-in-cell simulations. Finally, the general theoretical framework constructed during this short trip through chorus physics is used to draw analogies with condensed matter and laser physics as well as magnetic confinement fusion research. Discussing these analogies ultimately presents plasma physics as an exciting cross-disciplinary field to study.},

	abstract = {In recent years, planetary science has seen a tremendous growth in new knowledge. Deposits of water ice exist at the Moon's poles. Discoveries on the surface of Mars point to an early warm wet climate, and perhaps conditions under which life could have emerged. Liquid methane rain falls on Saturn's moon Titan, creating rivers, lakes, and geologic landscapes with uncanny resemblances to Earth's. 

Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 surveys the current state of knowledge of the solar system and recommends a suite of planetary science flagship missions for the decade 2013-2022 that could provide a steady stream of important new discoveries about the solar system. Research priorities defined in the report were selected through a rigorous review that included input from five expert panels. NASA's highest priority large mission should be the Mars Astrobiology Explorer Cacher (MAX-C), a mission to Mars that could help determine whether the planet ever supported life and could also help answer questions about its geologic and climatic history. Other projects should include a mission to Jupiter's icy moon Europa and its subsurface ocean, and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission to investigate that planet's interior structure, atmosphere, and composition. For medium-size missions, Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 recommends that NASA select two new missions to be included in its New Frontiers program, which explores the solar system with frequent, mid-size spacecraft missions. If NASA cannot stay within budget for any of these proposed flagship projects, it should focus on smaller, less expensive missions first.

Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022 suggests that the National Science Foundation expand its funding for existing laboratories and establish new facilities as needed.  It also recommends that the program enlist the participation of international partners. This report is a vital resource for government agencies supporting space science, the planetary science community, and the public.},

	abstract = {AbstractChorus waves play an important role in energetic electron dynamics in the inner magnetosphere. In this work, we present a new hybrid code, DAWN, to simulate the generation of chorus waves. The DAWN code is unique in that it models cold electrons using linearized fluid equations and hot electrons using particle-in-cell techniques. The simplified fluid equations can be solved with robust and simple algorithms. We demonstrate that discrete chorus elements can be generated using the code. Waveforms of the generated element show amplitude modulation or “subpackets,” and the frequency sweep rate of the generated element is found to be consistent with that of observed chorus waves. Using the DAWN code, we then investigate the variation of wave intensity () with respect to linear growth rates on the equatorial plane. Previous observations showed that the change in linear growth rates of whistler waves modulated by external processes such as density modulations is usually small (), while the variation of the wave intensity is large (). Using a chosen set of background plasma parameters, we demonstrate that a small change () in linear growth rates can lead to significant variation () of wave intensity only in the transition from the broadband whistler wave generation regime to the chorus wave generation regime. Our results demonstrate the importance of including nonlinear dynamics of chorus generation in understanding the whistler wave intensity modulation process in the inner magnetosphere.},

	abstract = {Chorus emissions are triggered from the linear cyclotron instability driven by the temperature anisotropy of energetic electrons (10–100 keV) in the magnetosphere. Chorus emissions grow as an absolute nonlinear instability near the magnetic equator because of the presence of an electromagnetic electron hole in velocity space. The transition process from the linear wave growth at a constant frequency to the nonlinear wave growth with a rising tone frequency is due to formation of a resonant current −JB antiparallel to the wave magnetic field. The rising-tone frequency introduces a phase shift to the electron hole at the equator and results in a resonant current component antiparallel to the wave electric field −JE, which causes the nonlinear wave growth. To confirm this triggering mechanism, we perform Vlasov hybrid simulations with JB and without JB. The run without JB does not reproduce chorus emissions, while the run with JB does successfully reproduce chorus emissions. The nonlinear frequency shift ω1 due to JB plays a critical role in the triggering process. The nonlinear transition time TN for the frequency shift is found to be of the same order as the nonlinear trapping period, which is confirmed by simulations and observation. The established frequency sweep rate is ω1/TN, which gives an optimum wave amplitude of chorus emissions.},

	abstract = {This work is a study of the non-linear interaction of cyclotron resonant electrons with a narrow band whistler wave travelling along a magnetospheric duct. The non-linear equations of motion are investigated and it is found that resonant electrons become stably trapped in the wave, and because of the magnetic field inhomogeneity such particles undergo a steady change in energy and magnetic moment. Extensive computations of the non-linear resonant particle current are made for a wide variety of choices for the wave field. Invariably it was found that the current was due chiefly to the displacement in energy of a bunch of stably trapped particles. A self-consistent computer program is constructed which follows in detail the time development of a morse pulse as it crosses the Equator. The program uses a model prescription for the resonant particle current as a function of field that assumes that trapped particles are the dominant contributors. With a suitable choice of parameters it was found that the model produced long emissions of rising frequency very similar in appearance to those in reality. One run produced a steep faller, also very much like those observed. Finally a very long pulse was put into the model and one obtained slow pulsations in amplitude similar to those noted by Bell and Helliwell. Although the self-consistent program suffers from an inability to handle large amplitude sideband waves, and has to be very heavily smoothed, the results show convincingly that the non-linear trapping of electrons in an inhomogeneous medium is fully able to account for triggering instability.},

	abstract = {Some of the spectral forms (e.g. ‘inverted’ hook) of discrete VLF emissions are not explained satisfactorily by present theories of generation based simply on gyroresonance between energetic streaming electrons and whistler-mode waves traveling in the opposite direction. An extension of the gyroresonance idea is proposed in which the spatial variations of the electron gyrofrequency and the Doppler-shifted wave frequency are matched. The coupling time between a resonant electron and the wave is then maximized, and hence the output wave intensity is maximized. Application of this condition leads directly to an expression for the time rate of change of emission frequency in terms of the location of the interaction region. An approximate analysis of the postulated interaction process leads to a theorem that states: The magnetic field intensity is limited to a value less than that at which the bunching time approximately equals the resonance time. When the input particle flux exceeds the value required to account for this limiting value of wave intensity, the interaction region drifts downstream. If the interaction begins on the falling-tone or ‘upstream’ side of the equator, positive drift carries the interaction across the equator into the rising-tone region, giving rise to the well known ‘hook’ shape. Reversal of the drift, resulting from wave damping or other factors, carries the interaction back across the equator, giving rise to the inverted hook, a shape not explained by previous theories. Combinations of positive and negative drifts can explain the principal emission forms. The triggering delay and offset frequency of artificially triggered discrete VLF emissions can be explained by the theory.},

In particular, we survey the statistics of occurrences and intensity of oblique chorus waves in the region of the outer radiation belt, comprised between the plasmapause and geostationary orbit, and discuss how their actual distribution may be explained by a combination of linear and non-linear generation, propagation, and damping processes. We further examine how such oblique wave populations can be included into both quasi-linear diffusion models and fully nonlinear models of wave-particle interaction. On this basis, we demonstrate that varying amounts of oblique waves can significantly change the rates of particle scattering, acceleration, and precipitation into the atmosphere during quiet times as well as in the course of a storm. Finally, we discuss possible generation mechanisms for such oblique waves in the radiation belts. We demonstrate that oblique whistler-mode chorus waves can be considered as an important ingredient of the radiation belt system and can play a key role in many aspects of wave-particle resonant interactions.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

In this paper, we advocate a personalized federated learning framework in a cloud-edge architecture for intelligent IoT applications. To cope with the heterogeneity issues in IoT environments, we investigate emerging personalized federated learning methods which are able to mitigate the negative effects caused by heterogeneities in different aspects. With the power of edge computing, the requirements for fast-processing capacity and low latency in intelligent IoT applications can also be achieved.

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a heavily promoted approach for training ML models on sensitive data, e.g., text typed by users on their smartphones. FL is expressly designed for training on data that are unbalanced and non-iid across the participants. To ensure privacy and integrity of the fedeated model, latest FL approaches use differential privacy or robust aggregation. We look at FL from the {\textbackslash}emph\{local\} viewpoint of an individual participant and ask: (1) do participants have an incentive to participate in FL? (2) how can participants {\textbackslash}emph\{individually\} improve the quality of their local models, without re-designing the FL framework and/or involving other participants? First, we show that on standard tasks such as next-word prediction, many participants gain no benefit from FL because the federated model is less accurate on their data than the models they can train locally on their own. Second, we show that differential privacy and robust aggregation make this problem worse by further destroying the accuracy of the federated model for many participants. Then, we evaluate three techniques for local adaptation of federated models: fine-tuning, multi-task learning, and knowledge distillation. We analyze where each is applicable and demonstrate that all participants benefit from local adaptation. Participants whose local models are poor obtain big accuracy improvements over conventional FL. Participants whose local models are better than the federated model{\textbackslash}textemdash and who have no incentive to participate in FL today{\textbackslash}textemdash improve less, but sufficiently to make the adapted federated model better than their local models.},

As a result, the global model can be smaller since it only operates on local representations, reducing the number of communicated parameters. Theoretically, we provide a generalization analysis which shows that a combination of local and global models reduces both variance in the data as well as variance across device distributions. Empirically, we demonstrate that local models enable communication-efficient training while retaining performance. We also evaluate on the task of personalized mood prediction from real-world mobile data where privacy is key.

	abstract = {In Federated Learning, we aim to train models across multiple computing units (users), while users can only communicate with a common central server, without exchanging their data samples. This mechanism exploits the computational power of all users and allows users to obtain a richer model as their models are trained over a larger set of data points. However, this scheme only develops a common output for all the users, and, therefore, it does not adapt the model to each user. This is an important missing feature, especially given the heterogeneity of the underlying data distribution for various users. In this paper, we study a personalized variant of the federated learning in which our goal is to find an initial shared model that current or new users can easily adapt to their local dataset by performing one or a few steps of gradient descent with respect to their own data. This approach keeps all the benefits of the federated learning architecture, and, by structure, leads to a more personalized model for each user. We show this problem can be studied within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework. Inspired by this connection, we study a personalized variant of the well-known Federated Averaging algorithm and evaluate its performance in terms of gradient norm for non-convex loss functions. Further, we characterize how this performance is affected by the closeness of underlying distributions of user data, measured in terms of distribution distances such as Total Variation and 1-Wasserstein metric.},

	abstract = {An iterative cluster Primal Dual Splitting algorithm for solving the large-scale sSVM problem in a decentralized fashion, which extracts important features discovered by the algorithm that are predictive of future hospitalizations, thus providing a way to interpret the classification results and inform prevention efforts. BACKGROUND
In an era of "big data," computationally efficient and privacy-aware solutions for large-scale machine learning problems become crucial, especially in the healthcare domain, where large amounts of data are stored in different locations and owned by different entities. Past research has been focused on centralized algorithms, which assume the existence of a central data repository (database) which stores and can process the data from all participants. Such an architecture, however, can be impractical when data are not centrally located, it does not scale well to very large datasets, and introduces single-point of failure risks which could compromise the integrity and privacy of the data. Given scores of data widely spread across hospitals/individuals, a decentralized computationally scalable methodology is very much in need.


OBJECTIVE
We aim at solving a binary supervised classification problem to predict hospitalizations for cardiac events using a distributed algorithm. We seek to develop a general decentralized optimization framework enabling multiple data holders to collaborate and converge to a common predictive model, without explicitly exchanging raw data.


METHODS
We focus on the soft-margin l1-regularized sparse Support Vector Machine (sSVM) classifier. We develop an iterative cluster Primal Dual Splitting (cPDS) algorithm for solving the large-scale sSVM problem in a decentralized fashion. Such a distributed learning scheme is relevant for multi-institutional collaborations or peer-to-peer applications, allowing the data holders to collaborate, while keeping every participant's data private.


RESULTS
We test cPDS on the problem of predicting hospitalizations due to heart diseases within a calendar year based on information in the patients Electronic Health Records prior to that year. cPDS converges faster than centralized methods at the cost of some communication between agents. It also converges faster and with less communication overhead compared to an alternative distributed algorithm. In both cases, it achieves similar prediction accuracy measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of the classifier. We extract important features discovered by the algorithm that are predictive of future hospitalizations, thus providing a way to interpret the classification results and inform prevention efforts.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel joint transmit power and resource allocation approach for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in vehicular networks is proposed. The objective is to minimize the network-wide power consumption of vehicular users (VUEs) while ensuring high reliability in terms of probabilistic queuing delays. In particular, a reliability measure is defined to characterize extreme events (i.e., when vehicles' queue lengths exceed a predefined threshold with non-negligible probability) using extreme value theory (EVT). Leveraging principles from federated learning (FL), the distribution of these extreme events corresponding to the tail distribution of queues is estimated by VUEs in a decentralized manner. Finally, Lyapunov optimization is used to find the joint transmit power and resource allocation policies for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed solution is validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility model. It is shown that FL enables the proposed distributed method to estimate the tail distribution of queues with an accuracy that is very close to a centralized solution with up to 79{\textbackslash}\% reductions in the amount of data that need to be exchanged. Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60{\textbackslash}\% reductions of VUEs with large queue lengths, without an additional power consumption, compared to an average queue-based baseline. Compared to systems with fixed power consumption and focusing on queue stability while minimizing average power consumption, the reduction in extreme events of the proposed method is about two orders of magnitude.},

To address this issue, we present Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), a novel Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) framework, which exploits geometric properties of the FL loss surface, to group the client population into clusters with jointly trainable data distributions. In contrast to existing FMTL approaches, CFL does not require any modifications to the FL communication protocol to be made, is applicable to general non-convex objectives (in particular deep neural networks) and comes with strong mathematical guarantees on the clustering quality. CFL is flexible enough to handle client populations that vary over time and can be implemented in a privacy preserving way. As clustering is only performed after Federated Learning has converged to a stationary point, CFL can be viewed as a post-processing method that will always achieve greater or equal performance than conventional FL by allowing clients to arrive at more specialized models. We verify our theoretical analysis in experiments with deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks on commonly used Federated Learning datasets.},

Standard "dense" implementations of convolutional networks are very inefficient when applied on such sparse data. We introduce new sparse convolutional operations that are designed to process spatially-sparse data more efficiently, and use them to develop spatially-sparse convolutional networks.

	abstract = {The generation process of whistler-mode chorus emissions is analyzed by both theory and simulation. Driven by an assumed strong temperature anisotropy of energetic electrons, the initial wave growth of chorus is linear. After the linear growth phase, the wave amplitude grows nonlinearly. It is found that the seeds of chorus emissions with rising frequency are generated near the magnetic equator as a result of a nonlinear growth mechanism that depends on the wave amplitude. We derive the relativistic second-order resonance condition for a whistler-mode wave with a varying frequency. Wave trapping of resonant electrons near the equator results in the formation of an electromagnetic electron hole in the wave phase space. For a specific wave phase variation, corresponding to a rising frequency, the electron hole can form a resonant current that causes growth of a wave with a rising frequency. Seeds of chorus elements grow from the saturation level of the whistler-mode instability at the equator and then propagate away from the equator. In the frame of reference moving with the group velocity, the wave frequency is constant. The wave amplitude is amplified by the nonlinear resonant current, which is sustained by the increasing inhomogeneity of the dipole magnetic field over some distance from the equator. Chorus elements are generated successively at the equator so long as a sufficient flux of energetic electrons with a strong temperature anisotropy is present.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the growth rate and eigenmode structures of the streaming sausage and kink instabilities in a current sheet with a super-Alfvénic flow are studied. Based on the linearized compressible MHD equations, we employ an initial-value method to obtain the growth rate and eigenmode profiles of the fastest growing mode which is either the streaming sausage mode or kink mode. The streaming sausage and kink instabilities, similar to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, are caused by the sheared plasma flow. The results show that for V0m = 2 VA∞ the sausage mode grows faster than the kink mode when β∞ {\textless} 1.5. When β∞ {\textgreater} 1.5, the streaming kink instability has a higher growth rate. Here VA∞ is the Alfvén velocity and β∞ is the ratio between the plasma and magnetic pressures far away from the current layer, and V0m is the maximum velocity of plasma flow at the current sheet. In addition, an analytical dispersion equation is obtained for an ideal four-layer model of the current sheet in the incompressible limit. In the presence of a finite resistivity, the mixed sausage-tearing mode or the streaming tearing mode may be excited, which leads to the formation of plasmoids in the magnetotail. As an application to the Earth's magnetotail, where super-Alfvénic plasma flows are observed in the plasma sheet and β∞ ≃ 0.1–0.3 in the lobes, it is suggested that the streaming sausage and streaming tearing instabilities may occur in the magnetotail. Some of the north-then-south or south-then-north Bz signatures observed in the distant magnetotail may be associated with the streaming sausage mode or the mixed sausage-tearing mode. It is also pointed out that kink modes are unlikely to occur in the magnetotail.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe magnetohydrodynamic linear stability with the localized bulk flow oriented parallel to the neutral sheet is investigated, by including the Hall effect and the guide magnetic field. We observe three different unstable modes: a “streaming tearing” mode at a slow flow speed, a “streaming sausage” mode at a medium flow speed, and a “streaming kink” mode at a fast flow speed. The streaming tearing and sausage modes have a standard tearing mode-like structure with symmetric density fluctuations in the neutral sheet, while the kink mode has an asymmetric fluctuation. The growth rate of the streaming tearing mode decreases with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, while the growth rates of the sausage and kink modes do not depend strongly on the Reynolds number. The sausage and kink modes can be unstable for not only super-Alfvénic flow but also sub-Alfvénic flow when the lobe density is low. The wavelengths of these unstable modes are of the same order of magnitude as the thickness of the plasma sheet. Their maximum growth rates are higher than that of a standard tearing mode, and under a strong guide magnetic field, the growth rates of the sausage and kink modes are enhanced, while under a weak guide magnetic field, they are suppressed. For a thin plasma sheet with the Hall effect, the fluctuations of the streaming modes can exist over the plasma sheet. These unstable modes may be regarded as being one of the processes generating Alfvénic turbulence in the plasma sheet during magnetic reconnection.},

Here we propose an alternative, where each client only federates with other relevant clients to obtain a stronger model per client-specific objectives. To achieve this personalization, rather than computing a single model average with constant weights for the entire federation as in traditional FL, we efficiently calculate optimal weighted model combinations for each client, based on figuring out how much a client can benefit from another's model. We do not assume knowledge of any underlying data distributions or client similarities, and allow each client to optimize for arbitrary target distributions of interest, enabling greater flexibility for personalization. We evaluate and characterize our method on a variety of federated settings, datasets, and degrees of local data heterogeneity. Our method outperforms existing alternatives, while also enabling new features for personalized FL such as transfer outside of local data distributions.},

This book, edited by and with contributions from leading scientists in the field, provides a comprehensive overview of recent theoretical and observational findings concerning the physics of reconnection and the complex structures that may give rise to, or develop from, reconnection.

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables resource-constrained edge nodes to collaboratively learn a global model under the orchestration of a central server while keeping privacy-sensitive data locally. The non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data samples across participating nodes slow model training and impose additional communication rounds for FL to converge. In this paper, we propose Federated Adaptive Weighting (FedAdp) algorithm that aims to accelerate model convergence under the presence of nodes with non-IID dataset. We observe the implicit connection between the node contribution to the global model aggregation and data distribution on the local node through theoretical and empirical analysis. We then propose to assign different weights for updating the global model based on node contribution adaptively through each training round. The contribution of participating nodes is first measured by the angle between the local gradient vector and the global gradient vector, and then, weight is quantified by a designed non-linear mapping function subsequently. The simple yet effective strategy can reinforce positive (suppress negative) node contribution dynamically, resulting in communication round reduction drastically. Its superiority over the commonly adopted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is verified both theoretically and experimentally. With extensive experiments performed in Pytorch and PySyft, we show that FL training with FedAdp can reduce the number of communication rounds by up to 54.1\% on MNIST dataset and up to 45.4\% on FashionMNIST dataset, as compared to FedAvg algorithm.},

In our work, we propose a personalized FL framework, PerFed-CKT, where clients can use heterogeneous model architectures and do not directly communicate their model parameters. PerFed-CKT uses clustered co-distillation, where clients use logits to transfer their knowledge to other clients that have similar data-distributions. We theoretically show the convergence and generalization properties of PerFed-CKT and empirically show that PerFed-CKT achieves high test accuracy with several orders of magnitude lower communication cost compared to the state-of-the-art personalized FL schemes.},

The book focuses on the various reconnection mechanisms dominating magnetic processes under the different plasma conditions encountered in astrophysical systems and in laboratory fusion devices. The book consists of two major parts: the first deals with the classical resistive approach, while the second presents an overview of weakly collisional or collisionless plasmas. Applications primarily concern astrophysical phenomena and dynamo theory, with emphasis on the solar and geodynamo, as well as magnetospheric substorms, the most spectacular reconnection events in the magnetospheric plasma. The theoretical procedures and results also apply directly to reconnection processes in laboratory plasmas, in particular the sawtooth phenomenon in tokamaks. The book will be of value to graduate students and researchers interested in magnetic processes both in astrophysical and laboratory plasma physics.},

In strongly collisional plasmas reconnection proceeds via resistive current sheets, i.e. quasi-stationary macroscopic Sweet-Parker sheets at intermediate values of the magnetic Reynolds numberRm, or mirco-current sheets in MHD turbulence, which develops at highRm. In hot, dilute plasmas the reconnection dynamics is dominated by nondissipative effects, mainly the Hall term and electron inertia. Reconnection rates are found to depend only on the ion mass, being independent of the electron inertia and the residual dissipation coefficients. Small-scale whistler turbulence is readily excited giving rise to an anomalous electron viscosity. Hence reconnection may be much more rapid than predicted by conventional resistive theory.},

	abstract = {The Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) provides a high-performance flexible framework for physics-based space weather simulations, as well as for various space physics applications. The SWMF integrates numerical models of the Solar Corona, Eruptive Event Generator, Inner Heliosphere, Solar Energetic Particles, Global Magnetosphere, Inner Magnetosphere, Radiation Belt, Ionosphere Electrodynamics, and Upper Atmosphere into a high-performance coupled model. The components can be represented with alternative physics models, and any physically meaningful subset of the components can be used. The components are coupled to the control module via standardized interfaces, and an efficient parallel coupling toolkit is used for the pairwise coupling of the components. The execution and parallel layout of the components is controlled by the SWMF. Both sequential and concurrent execution models are supported. The SWMF enables simulations that were not possible with the individual physics models. Using reasonably high spatial and temporal resolutions in all of the coupled components, the SWMF runs significantly faster than real time on massively parallel supercomputers. This paper presents the design and implementation of the SWMF and some demonstrative tests. Future papers will describe validation (comparison of model results with measurements) and applications to challenging space weather events. The SWMF is publicly available to the scientific community for doing geophysical research. We also intend to expand the SWMF in collaboration with other model developers.},

	abstract = {Space weather describes the various processes in the Sun–Earth system that present danger to human health and technology. The goal of space weather forecasting is to provide an opportunity to mitigate these negative effects. Physics-based space weather modeling is characterized by disparate temporal and spatial scales as well as by different relevant physics in different domains. A multi-physics system can be modeled by a software framework comprising several components. Each component corresponds to a physics domain, and each component is represented by one or more numerical models. The publicly available Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) can execute and couple together several components distributed over a parallel machine in a flexible and efficient manner. The framework also allows resolving disparate spatial and temporal scales with independent spatial and temporal discretizations in the various models. Several of the computationally most expensive domains of the framework are modeled by the Block-Adaptive Tree Solarwind Roe-type Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) code that can solve various forms of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, including Hall, semi-relativistic, multi-species and multi-fluid MHD, anisotropic pressure, radiative transport and heat conduction. Modeling disparate scales within BATS-R-US is achieved by a block-adaptive mesh both in Cartesian and generalized coordinates. Most recently we have created a new core for BATS-R-US: the Block-Adaptive Tree Library (BATL) that provides a general toolkit for creating, load balancing and message passing in a 1, 2 or 3 dimensional block-adaptive grid. We describe the algorithms of BATL and demonstrate its efficiency and scaling properties for various problems. BATS-R-US uses several time-integration schemes to address multiple time-scales: explicit time stepping with fixed or local time steps, partially steady-state evolution, point-implicit, semi-implicit, explicit/implicit, and fully implicit numerical schemes. Depending on the application, we find that different time stepping methods are optimal. Several of the time integration schemes exploit the block-based granularity of the grid structure. The framework and the adaptive algorithms enable physics-based space weather modeling and even short-term forecasting.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the numerical modeling of the outer magnetosphere. The global magnetosphere is the space surrounding the Earth, including the bow shock, the magnetosphere, and the magnetotail. For sake of limiting the scope, models of the thermosphere, ionosphere, polar wind, radiation belts, and inner magnetosphere are not described here; however, their interaction with the global magnetosphere model is an unavoidable complication that has to be addressed. The major challenges of modeling the outer mangetosphere are the scarcity of observational data, the disparate temporal and spatial scales, and the complexity of the physical system. The outer magnetosphere can be approximated with various physical models ranging from simple single fluid ideal magnetohydrodynamics to full kinetic description of the multispecies space plasma. While the magnetohydrodynamic description is surprisingly successful in getting the global structure approximately right, some of the key processes affecting the dynamics require more sophisticated models. In particular, the magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail plays a crucial role not only in the tail but also for the entire system. We describe several numerical approaches to deal with this diverse set of challenges. The discussion is kept brief: our goal is to describe the main features and point out the important differences among the various physical and numerical approximations, so that nonexpert model users, observers, and data analysts who carry out simulations and/or use simulation results can better understand what these models can and cannot do.},

	abstract = {Europa  (listen), or Jupiter II, is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, and the sixth-closest to the planet of all the 79 known moons of Jupiter. It is also the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Europa was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named after Europa, the Phoenician mother of King Minos of Crete and lover of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter).
Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, but craters are relatively few. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s.
Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath the surface, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the sea floor. This may be important in determining whether Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers. In May 2018, astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on Europa, based on an updated analysis of data obtained from the Galileo space probe, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon.The Galileo mission, launched in 1989, provides the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, although there have been several proposed exploration missions. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a mission to Ganymede that is due to launch in 2023 and will include two flybys of Europa. NASA's planned Europa Clipper should be launched in 2024.},

Although much has been learned in recent decades from advances in observations, theory, and computer simulations, we still have not identified definitively the physical processes that heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind. In this review, we summarize these recent advances and speculate about what else is required to finally understand the fundamental physics of this complex system. Specifically: ▪ We discuss recent subarcsecond observations of the corona, some of which appear to provide evidence for tangled and braided magnetic fields and some of which do not. ▪ We review results from three-dimensional numerical simulations that, despite limitations in dynamic range, reliably contain sufficient heating to produce and maintain the corona. ▪ We provide a new tabulation of scaling relations for a number of proposed coronal heating theories that involve waves, turbulence, braiding, nanoflares, and helicity conservation. An understanding of these processes is important not only for improving our ability to forecast hazardous space-weather events but also for establishing a baseline of knowledge about a well-resolved star that is relevant to other astrophysical systems.},

	abstract = {Since its discovery in 1610, Europa—one of Jupiter's four large moons—has been an object of interest to astronomers and planetary scientists. Much of this interest stems from observations made by NASA's Voyager and Galileo spacecraft and from Earth-based telescopes indicating that Europa's surface is quite young, with very little evidence of cratering, and made principally of water ice.
More recently, theoretical models of the jovian system and Europa have suggested that tidal heating may have resulted in the existence of liquid water, and perhaps an ocean, beneath Europa's surface. NASA's ongoing Galileo mission has profoundly expanded our understanding of Europa and the dynamics of the jovian system, and may allow us to constrain theoretical models of Europa's subsurface structure.
Meanwhile, since the time of the Voyagers, there has been a revolution in our understanding of the limits of life on Earth. Life has been detected thriving in environments previously thought to be untenable—around hydrothermal vent systems on the seafloor, deep underground in basaltic rocks, and within polar ice. Elsewhere in the solar system, including on Europa, environments thought to be compatible with life as we know it on Earth are now considered possible, or even probable. Spacecraft missions are being planned that may be capable of proving their existence.
Against this background, the Space Studies Board charged its Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration (COMPLEX) to perform a comprehensive study to assess current knowledge about Europa, outline a strategy for future spacecraft missions to Europa, and identify opportunities for complementary Earth-based studies of Europa.

	abstract = {It has been proposed that Jupiter's satellite Europa currently possesses a global subsurface ocean of liquid water. Galileo gravity data verify that the satellite is differentiated into an outer H2O layer about 100 km thick but cannot determine the current physical state of this layer (liquid or solid). Here we summarize the geological evidence regarding an extant subsurface ocean, concentrating on Galileo imaging data. We describe and assess nine pertinent lines of geological evidence: impact morphologies, lenticulae, cryovolcanic features, pull-apart bands, chaos, ridges, surface frosts, topography, and global tectonics. An internal ocean would be a simple and comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observations; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that all of the surface morphologies could be due to processes in warm, soft ice with only localized or partial melting. Two different models of impact flux imply very different surface ages for Europa; the model favored here indicates an average age of ∼50 Myr. Searches for evidence of current geological activity on Europa, such as plumes or surface changes, have yielded negative results to date. The current existence of a global subsurface ocean, while attractive in explaining the observations, remains inconclusive. Future geophysical measurements are essential to determine conclusively whether or not there is a liquid water ocean within Europa today.},

	abstract = {Galileo data enable the major geological units, structures, and surface features to be identified on Europa. These include five primary units (plains, chaos, band, ridge, and crater materials) and their subunits, along with various tectonic structures such as faults. Plains units are the most widespread. Ridged plains material spans a wide range of geological ages, including the oldest recognizable features on Europa, and appears to represent a style of tectonic resurfacing, rather than cryovolcanism. Smooth plains material typically embays other terrains and units, possibly as a type of fluid emplacement, and is among the youngest material units observed. At global scales, plains are typically mapped as undifferentiated plains material, although in some areas differences can be discerned in the near infrared which might be related to differences in ice grain size. Chaos material is composed of plains and other preexisting materials that have been severely disrupted by inferred internal activity; chaos is characterized by blocks of icy material set in a hummocky matrix. Band material is arrayed in linear, curvilinear, wedge-shaped, or cuspate zones with contrasting albedo and surface textures with respect to the surrounding terrain. Bilateral symmetry observed in some bands and the relationships with the surrounding units suggest that band material forms by the lithosphere fracturing, spreading apart, and infilling with material derived from the subsurface. Ridge material is mapped as a unit on local and some regional maps but shown with symbols at global scales. Ridge material includes single ridges, doublet ridges, and ridge complexes. Ridge materials are considered to represent tectonic processes, possibly accompanied by the extrusion or intrusion of subsurface materials, such as diapirs. The tectonic processes might be related to tidal flexing of the icy lithosphere on diurnal or longer timescales. Crater materials include various interior (smooth central, rough inner, and annular massif) and exterior (continuous ejecta) subunits. Structural features and landforms are shown with conventional symbols. Type localities for the units are identified, along with suggestions for portraying the features on geological maps, including colors and letter abbreviations for material units. Implementing these suggestions by the planetary mapping community would facilitate comparisons of maps for different parts of Europa and contribute to an eventual global synthesis of its complex geology. On the basis of initial mapping results, a stratigraphic sequence is suggested in which ridged plains form the oldest unit on Europa, followed by development of band material and individual ridges. Band materials tend to be somewhat older than ridges, but in many areas the two units formed simultaneously. Similarly, the formation of most chaos follows the development of ridged plains; although chaos is among the youngest materials on Europa, some chaos units might have formed contemporaneously with ridged plains. Smooth plains generally embay all other units and are late-stage in the evolution of the surface. C1 craters are superposed on ridged plains but are crosscut by other materials, including bands and ridges. Most c2 craters postdate all other units, but a few c2 craters are cut by ridge material. C3 craters constitute the youngest recognizable material on Europa.},

	volume = {42},
	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018cosp...42E1363H},
	abstract = {In June of 2016 NASA convened a 21-person team of scientists to establish the science goals, objectives, investigations, measurement requirements, and model payload of a Europa lander mission concept. The Europa Lander Science Definition Team (SDT), following a charter from NASA HQ, refined these requirements into a viable Europa Lander mission concept, and published the Europa Lander Study 2016 report (Europa Lander, 2016). Since the completion of the SDT report, the Europa Lander mission concept team at JPL has refined the mission concept through a Mission Concept Review (MCR), and subsequently through the advice and oversight of an external advisory board. This board was active during the Summer and Fall of 2017, and a final report was presented to NASA HQ in the late Fall of 2017. The Europa Lander mission concept team is currently addressing guidance from NASA HQ in terms of technologies and mission architecture. The science of the mission concept has remained largely constant with respect to the 2016 SDT Report. Europa Lander SDT Science GoalsThe NASA HQ Europa Lander SDT Charter goals, in priority order, were as follows:1. Search for evidence of life on Europa.2. Assess the habitability of Europa via in situ techniques uniquely available to a lander mission.3. Characterize surface and subsurface properties at the scale of the lander to support future exploration of Europa.Within Goal 1, the SDT developed four Objectives for seeking signs of life (i.e., biosignatures). These include the need to: a) detect and characterize any o ganic indicators of past or present life, b) identify and characterize morphological, textural, and other indicators of life, c) detect and characterize any inorganic indicators of past or present life, and d) determine the provenance of Lander-sampled material. Within the Goal 1 investigations and measurement requirements there are more than seven distinct and complementary approaches for detecting potential biosignatures within material sampled from Europa's surface and near-subsurface. Goal 2 focuses on Europa's habitability and ensures that even in the absence of the detection of any potential biosignatures, significant ocean world science is still achieved. The objectives within Goal 2 are to: a) characterize the non-ice composition of Europa's near-surface material and determine whether there are indicators of chemical disequilibria, and b) determine the proximity to liquid water and recently erupted materials at the lander's location.Goal 3 ensures that the landing site region is quantitatively characterized in the context needed for Goals 1 and 2, and that key measurements about Europa's ice shell are made to enable future exploration. The objectives for Goal 3 include the need to: a) observe the properties of surface materials and sub-meter-scale landing hazards at the landing site, including the sampled area (connecting local properties with those seen from precursor Europa flyby remote sensing), and b) characterize dynamic processes on Europa's surface and ice shell over the mission duration to understand exogenous and endogenous effects on the physiochemical properties of surface and shallow sub-surface materials.The Europa Lander mission concept is capable of achieving a suite of measurements such that if potential biosignatures are present on Europa's surface they could be detected at levels comparable to those found in benchmark environments on Earth, and, further, that even if no potential biosignatures are detected, the science return of the mission will significantly advance our fundamental understanding of Europa's chemistry, geology, geophysics, and habitability.References: Europa Lander Study 2016 Report: Europa Lander Mission.

Here we review Europa's suitability for life from the perspective of these three requirements. It is likely, though not yet certain, that Europa harbors a subsurface ocean of liquid water whose volume is about twice that of Earth's oceans. Little is known about Europa's inventory of carbon, nitrogen, and other biogenic elements, but lower bounds on these can be placed by considering the role of cometary delivery over Europa's history. Sources of free energy are challenging for a world covered with an ice layer kilometers thick, but it is possible that hydrothermal activity and/or organics and oxidants provided by the action of radiation chemistry at Europa's surface and subsequent mixing into Europa's ocean could provide the electron donors and acceptors needed to power a Europan ecosystem. It is not premature to draw lessons from the search for life on Mars with the Viking spacecraft for planning exobiological missions to Europa.},

We can recognise the residual biochemicals long after life has expired and otherwise lost most life-defining features. Carbon chemistry provides a tool for identifying extant and extinct life on Earth and, potentially, throughout the Universe. In recognizing that certain distinctive compounds isolable from living systems had related fossil derivatives, organic geochemists coined the term biological marker compound or biomarker (e.g. Eglinton et al. in Science 145:263–264, 1964) to describe them. In this terminology, biomarkers are metabolites or biochemicals by which we can identify particular kinds of living organisms as well as the molecular fossil derivatives by which we identify defunct counterparts.

	abstract = {Distributed estimation has been an active research area since the late 1970's, starting with decentralized filtering and estimation for control of large scale systems. Early research focused on optimal fusion to reconstruct the best global estimate by de-correlating the local estimates to avoid double counting of information. This approach was extended to distributed estimation for general sensor networks using information graphs in the 1980's, with channel filter as a special case for acyclic networks. Track fusion for systems with process noise led to a general framework for linear estimate fusion given cross covariances in the 1990's. Fusion rules include maximum likelihood, maximum a posteriori probability, and best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE). BLUE is based on a unified fusion model, which has been used to develop other fusion rules. In addition, covariance intersection handles situations where correlation information is completely unknown. Advances in sensing and communication hardware have resulted in low-cost wireless ad hoc sensor networks around 2000. These require robust distributed estimation algorithms such as consensus-based filters and diffusion-based filters, which have other performance criteria than estimation accuracy. There was recent resurgent interest in distributed estimation algorithms that handle process noise. Examples are distributed Kalman filters using pseudo estimates and distributed accumulated state density filters.},

	abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.},

	abstract = {A wide variety of distortion functions, such as squared Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Itakura-Saito distance and relative entropy, have been used for clustering. In this paper, we propose and analyze parametric hard and soft clustering algorithms based on a large class of distortion functions known as Bregman divergences. The proposed algorithms unify centroid-based parametric clustering approaches, such as classical kmeans, the Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) algorithm and information-theoretic clustering, which arise by special choices of the Bregman divergence. The algorithms maintain the simplicity and scalability of the classical kmeans algorithm, while generalizing the method to a large class of clustering loss functions. This is achieved by first posing the hard clustering problem in terms of minimizing the loss in Bregman information, a quantity motivated by rate distortion theory, and then deriving an iterative algorithm that monotonically decreases this loss. In addition, we show that there is a bijection between regular exponential families and a large class of Bregman divergences, that we call regular Bregman divergences. This result enables the development of an alternative interpretation of an efficient EM scheme for learning mixtures of exponential family distributions, and leads to a simple soft clustering algorithm for regular Bregman divergences. Finally, we discuss the connection between rate distortion theory and Bregman clustering and present an information theoretic analysis of Bregman clustering algorithms in terms of a trade-off between compression and loss in Bregman information.},

This paper traces the history of research in sensor networks over the past three decades, including two important programs of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) spanning this period: the Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) and the Sensor Information Technology (SensIT) programs. Technology trends that impact the development of sensor networks are reviewed, and new applications such as infrastructure security, habitat monitoring, and traffic control are presented. Technical challenges in sensor network development include network discovery, control and routing, collaborative signal and information processing, tasking and querying, and security. The paper concludes by presenting some recent research results in sensor network algorithms, including localized algorithms and directed diffusion, distributed tracking in wireless ad hoc networks, and distributed classification using local agents.},

	abstract = {Communication cost is often a bottleneck in federated learning and other client-based distributed learning scenarios. To overcome this, several gradient compression and model compression algorithms have been proposed. In this work, we propose an alternative approach whereby an ensemble of pre-trained base predictors is trained via federated learning. This method allows for training a model which may otherwise surpass the communication bandwidth and storage capacity of the clients to be learned with on-device data through federated learning. Motivated by language modeling, we prove the optimality of ensemble methods for density estimation for standard empirical risk minimization and agnostic risk minimization. We provide communication-efficient ensemble algorithms for federated learning, where per-round communication cost is independent of the size of the ensemble. Furthermore, unlike works on gradient compression, our proposed approach reduces the communication cost of both server-to-client and client-to-server communication.},

	abstract = {The focus of this paper is to develop a framework for distributed estimation via convex optimization. We deal with a network of complex sensor subsystems with local estimation and signal processing. More speciﬁcally, the sensor subsystems locally solve a maximum likelihood (or maximum a posteriori probability) estimation problem by maximizing a (strictly) concave log-likelihood function subject to convex constraints. These local implementations are not revealed outside the subsystem. The subsystems interact with one another via convex coupling constraints. We discuss a distributed estimation scheme to fuse the local subsystem estimates into a globally optimal estimate that satisﬁes the coupling constraints. The approach uses dual decomposition techniques in combination with the subgradient method to develop a simple distributed estimation algorithm. Many existing methods of data fusion are suboptimal, i.e., they do not maximize the loglikelihood exactly but rather ‘fuse’ partial results from many processors. For linear gaussian formulation, least mean square (LMS) consensus provides optimal (maximum likelihood) solution. The main contribution of this work is to provide a new approach for data fusion which is based on distributed convex optimization. It applies to a class of problems, described by concave log-likelihood functions, which is much broader than the LMS consensus setup.},

	abstract = {In Distributed Algorithms, Nancy Lynch provides a blueprint for designing, implementing, and analyzing distributed algorithms. She directs her book at a wide audience, including students, programmers, system designers, and researchers. Distributed Algorithms contains the most significant algorithms and impossibility results in the area, all in a simple automata-theoretic setting. The algorithms are proved correct, and their complexity is analyzed according to precisely defined complexity measures. The problems covered include resource allocation, communication, consensus among distributed processes, data consistency, deadlock detection, leader election, global snapshots, and many others. The material is organized according to the system model-first by the timing model and then by the interprocess communication mechanism. The material on system models is isolated in separate chapters for easy reference. The presentation is completely rigorous, yet is intuitive enough for immediate comprehension. This book familiarizes readers with important problems, algorithms, and impossibility results in the area: readers can then recognize the problems when they arise in practice, apply the algorithms to solve them, and use the impossibility results to determine whether problems are unsolvable. The book also provides readers with the basic mathematical tools for designing new algorithms and proving new impossibility results. In addition, it teaches readers how to reason carefully about distributed algorithms-to model them formally, devise precise specifications for their required behavior, prove their correctness, and evaluate their performance with realistic measures.

	abstract = {The problem under discussion is that of calculating magnetic field configurations in which the Lorentz force j x B is everywhere zero, subject to specified boundary conditions. We choose to represent the magnetic field in terms of Clebsch variables in the form B = grad alpha x grad beta. These variables are constant on any field line so that each field line is labeled by the corresponding values of alpha and beta. When the field is described in this way, the most appropriate choice of boundary conditions is to specify the values of alpha and beta on the bounding surface. We show that such field configurations may be calculated by a magneto-frictional method. We imagine that the field lines move through a stationary medium, and that each element of magnetic field is subject to a frictional force parallel to and opposing the velocity of the field line. This concept leads to an iteration procedure for modifying the variables alpha and beta, that tends asymptotically towards the force-free state. We apply the method first to a simple problem in two rectangular dimensions, and then to a problem of cylindrical symmetry that was previously discussed by Barnes and Sturrock (1972). In one important respect, our new results differ from the earlier results of Barnes and Sturrock, and we conclude that the earlier article was in error.},

	abstract = {The impact of the dynamic evolution of the Storm-Enhanced Density (SED) on the upward ion fluxes during the March 06, 2016 geomagnetic storm is studied using comprehensive multi-scale datasets. This storm was powered by a Corotating Interaction Region (CIR), and the minimum Sym-H reached ∼−110 nT. During the ionospheric positive storm phase, the SED formed and the associated plume and polar cap patches occasionally drifted anti-sunward across the polar cap. When these high-density structures encountered positive vertical flows, large ion upward fluxes were produced, with the largest upward flux reaching 3 × 1014 m−2s−1. These upflows were either the type-1 ion upflow associated with fast flow channels, such as the subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) channel, or the type-2 ion upflow due to soft particle precipitations in the cusp region. The total SED-associated upflow flux in the dayside cusp can be comparable to the total upflow flux in the nightside auroral zone despite the much smaller cusp area compared with the auroral zone. During the ionospheric negative storm phase, the ionospheric densities within the SED and plume decreased significantly and thus led to largely reduced upward fluxes. This event analysis demonstrates the critical role of the ionospheric high-density structures in creating large ion upward fluxes. It also suggests that the dynamic processes in the coupled ionosphere-thermosphere system and the resulting state of the ionospheric storm are crucial for understanding the temporal and spatial variations of ion upflow fluxes and thus should be incorporated into coupled geospace models for improving our holistic understanding of the role of ionospheric plasma in the geospace system.},

	abstract = {The Earth's ionosphere plays an important role in supplying plasma into the magnetosphere through ion upflow/outflow, particularly during periods of strong solar wind driving. An intense ion upflow flux event during the 1 June 2013 storm has been studied using observations from multiple instruments. When the open-closed field line boundary (OCB) moved into the Poker Flat incoherent scatter radar (PFISR) field of view, divergent ion fluxes were observed by PFISR with intense upflow fluxes reaching 1.9 × 1014 m−2 s−1 at 600 km altitude. Both ion and electron temperatures increased significantly within the ion upflow, and thus, this event has been classified as a type 2 upflow. We discuss factors contributing to the high electron density and intense ion upflow fluxes, including plasma temperature effect and preconditioning by storm-enhanced density (SED). Our analysis shows that the significantly enhanced electron temperature due to soft electron precipitation in the cusp can reduce the dissociative recombination rate of molecular ions above 400 km and contributed to the density increase. In addition, this intense ion upflow flux event is preconditioned by the lifted F region ionosphere due to northwestward convection flows in the SED plume. During this event, the OCB and cusp were detected by DMSP between 15 and 16 magnetic local times, unusually duskward. Results from a global magnetohydrodynamics simulation using the Space Weather Modeling Framework have been used to provide a global context for this event. This case study provides a more comprehensive mechanism for the generation of intense ion upflow fluxes observed in association with SEDs.},

The need for this book is twofold. First, although linear estimation theory is relatively well known, it is largely scattered in the journal literature and has not been collected in a single source. Second, available literature on the continuous nonlinear theory is quite esoteric and controversial, and thus inaccessible to engineers uninitiated in measure theory and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, it is not clear from the available literature whether the nonlinear theory can be applied to practical engineering problems. In attempting to fill the stated needs, the author has retained as much mathematical rigor as he felt was consistent with the prime objective—to explain the theory to engineers. Thus, the author has avoided measure theory in this book by using mean square convergence, on the premise that everyone knows how to average. As a result, the author only requires of the reader background in advanced calculus, theory of ordinary differential equations, and matrix analysis.},

	abstract = {A rich set of new measurements has greatly expanded our understanding of the Moon–plasma interaction over the last sixteen years, and helped demonstrate the fundamentally kinetic nature of many aspects thereof. Photon and charged particle impacts act to charge the lunar surface, forming thin Debye-scale plasma sheaths above both sunlit and shadowed hemispheres. These impacts also produce photoelectrons and secondary electrons from the surface, as well as ions from the surface and exosphere, all of which in turn feed back into the plasma environment. The solar wind interacts with sub-ion-inertial-scale crustal magnetic fields to form what may be the smallest magnetospheres in the solar system. Proton gyro-motion, solar wind pickup of protons scattered from the dayside surface, and plasma expansion into vacuum each affect the dynamics and structure of different portions of the lunar plasma wake. The Moon provides us with a basic plasma physics laboratory for the study of fundamental processes, some of which we cannot easily observe elsewhere. At the same time, the Moon provides us with a test bed for the study of processes that also operate at many other solar system bodies. We have learned much about the Moon–plasma interaction, with implications for other space and planetary environments. However, many fundamental problems remain unsolved, including the details of the coupling between various parts of the plasma environment, as well as between plasma and the surface, neutral exosphere, and dust. In this paper, we describe our current understanding of the lunar plasma environment, including illustrative new results from Lunar Prospector and Kaguya, and outstanding unsolved problems.},

She pointed out that there, faculty never read letters: they only write them. Even graduate students are admitted purely on the basis of test scores.

The facts were hardly surprising—after all, this is the system I grew up with in India—but after hearing the way she put it, the proverbial bulb lit up. If you never evaluate letters yourself, how would you know what letters should and shouldn't contain? The feedback—admission decisions—is seemingly random, and therefore of little use. Hence this article.},

Here, as in the original talk, I offer some practical advice for thinking about one's work within the larger frame of your personal values and goals. While I will draw examples from my own career, I hope to offer readers guidance in articulating what is important to them, aligning their career choices with those values, and establishing metrics that go beyond the h-index.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

In this work, we present a large-scale two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation of a reconnecting magnetopause hit by a propagating plasmaspheric plume. The simulation is designed so that it undergoes four distinct phases: initial unsteady state, steady state prior to plume arrival at the magnetospause, plume interaction, and steady state once the plume is well engulfed in the reconnection site. We show the evolution of the magnetopause's dynamics subjected to the modification of the inflowing plasma. Our main result is that the change in the plasma temperature (cold protons in the plume) has no effects on the magnetic reconnection rate, which on average depends only on the inflowing magnetic field and total ion density, before, during, and after the impact.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present federated analytics, a new distributed computing paradigm for data analytics applications with privacy concerns. With the advances of sensing, communication, and edge computing technologies, data are massively generated, transmitted and analyzed in an edge-cloud computing environment. In many applications, the edge devices and the data generated in the edge belong to heterogeneous owners. The data privacy and conﬁdentiality have become increasing concerns to these owners. The current edge-cloud computing paradigm for data analytics, where data are sent to a central server for analytics, can no longer match the application requirements. Federated analytics is a newly proposed computing paradigm where raw data are kept local with local analytics and only the insights generated from local analytics are sent to a server for result aggregation. Federated analytics differs from the recent federated learning paradigm in the sense that federated learning emphasizes on collaborative model training, whereas federated analytics emphasizes on drawing conclusions from data. In this paper, we ﬁrst clarify what federated analytics is and its position in the research literature. We then present why we need federated analytics, i.e., the motivation and application case studies. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of federated analytics.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. It can train a global model with multiple participants and at the same time ensure the privacy of the participants’ data. Thus, FL provides a solution for the problems faced by data silos. Existing federated learning algorithms face two significant challenges when dealing with (1) non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and (2) data with noise or without preprocessing. To address these challenges, a novel federated learning approach based on the confidence of federated Kalman filters is proposed and is referred to as FedCK in this paper. Firstly, this paper proposes a deep Generative Adversarial Network with an advanced auxiliary classifier as a pre-training module. The Non-IID increases the discreteness of the parameters of local models, it is difficult for FL to aggregate an excellent global model. The pre-training module proposed in this paper can deeply mine hidden features and increase the correlation between local model parameters. Secondly, a federated learning framework based on Federated Kalman Filter (FKF) is proposed in this paper. Because the general federation average aggregation algorithm cannot identify the model parameters with noise. This paper uses the idea of FKF to propose a set of adaptive confidence to improve the fault tolerance of FL. Experiments carried out on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets demonstrate that FedCK has better robustness and accuracy than classical federated learning methods.},

	abstract = {An efficient, federated Kalman filtering method is presented, based on rigorous information-sharing principles. The method applies to decentralized navigation systems in which one or more sensor-dedicated local filters feed a larger master filter. The local filters operate in parallel, processing unique data from their local sensors, and common data from a shared inertial navigation system. The master filter combines local filter outputs at a selectable reduced rate, and yields estimates that are globally optimal or subset-optimal. The method provides major improvements in throughput (speed) and fault tolerance, and is well suited to real-time implementation. Practical federated filter examples are presented, and discussed in terms of structure, accuracy, fault tolerance, throughput, data compression, and other real-time issues.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09888},
	abstract = {The increasing interest in user privacy is leading to new privacy preserving machine learning paradigms. In the Federated Learning paradigm, a master machine learning model is distributed to user clients, the clients use their locally stored data and model for both inference and calculating model updates. The model updates are sent back and aggregated on the server to update the master model then redistributed to the clients. In this paradigm, the user data never leaves the client, greatly enhancing the user' privacy, in contrast to the traditional paradigm of collecting, storing and processing user data on a backend server beyond the user's control. In this paper we introduce, as far as we are aware, the first federated implementation of a Collaborative Filter. The federated updates to the model are based on a stochastic gradient approach. As a classical case study in machine learning, we explore a personalized recommendation system based on users' implicit feedback and demonstrate the method's applicability to both the MovieLens and an in-house dataset. Empirical validation confirms a collaborative filter can be federated without a loss of accuracy compared to a standard implementation, hence enhancing the user's privacy in a widely used recommender application while maintaining recommender performance.},

The characteristic length scales include the size of the heliosphere, the collisional mean free paths of all species, their inertial lengths, their gyration radii, and their Debye lengths. The characteristic timescales include the expansion time, the collision times, and the periods associated with gyration, waves, and oscillations. We review the past and present research into the multi-scale nature of the solar wind based on in-situ spacecraft measurements and plasma theory. We emphasize that couplings of processes across scales are important for the global dynamics and thermodynamics of the solar wind. We describe methods to measure in-situ properties of particles and fields. We then discuss the role of expansion effects, non-equilibrium distribution functions, collisions, waves, turbulence, and kinetic microinstabilities for the multi-scale plasma evolution.},

	abstract = {The hot and diffuse nature of the Sun’s extended atmosphere allows it to persist in non-equilibrium states for long enough that wave–particle instabilities can arise and modify the evolution of the expanding solar wind. Determining which instabilities arise, and how significant a role they play in governing the dynamics of the solar wind, has been a decades-long process involving in situ observations at a variety of radial distances. With new measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), we can study what wave modes are driven near the Sun, and calculate what instabilities are predicted for different models of the underlying particle populations. We model two hours-long intervals of PSP/SPAN-i measurements of the proton phase-space density during the PSP’s fourth perihelion with the Sun using two commonly used descriptions for the underlying velocity distribution. The linear stability and growth rates associated with the two models are calculated and compared. We find that both selected intervals are susceptible to resonant instabilities, though the growth rates and kinds of modes driven unstable vary depending on whether the protons are modeled using one or two components. In some cases, the predicted growth rates are large enough to compete with other dynamic processes, such as the nonlinear turbulent transfer of energy, in contrast with relatively slower instabilities at larger radial distances from the Sun.},

	abstract = {We apply field-particle correlations - a technique that tracks the time-averaged velocity-space structure of the energy density transfer rate between electromagnetic fields and plasma particles - to data drawn from a hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulation of Alfvén-ion cyclotron turbulence. Energy transfer in this system is expected to include both Landau and cyclotron wave-particle resonances, unlike previous systems to which the field-particle correlation technique has been applied. In this simulation, the energy transfer rate mediated by the parallel electric field \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}Vert \}\$ comprises approximately 60 \% of the total rate, with the remainder mediated by the perpendicular electric field \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}bot \}\$. The parallel electric field resonantly couples to protons, with the canonical bipolar velocity-space signature of Landau damping identified at many points throughout the simulation. The energy transfer mediated by \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}bot \}\$ preferentially couples to particles with \$v\_\{tp\}{\textbackslash}lesssim v\_\{{\textbackslash}bot \}{\textbackslash}lesssim 3v\_\{tp\}\$, where \$v\_\{tp\}\$ is the proton thermal speed, in agreement with the expected formation of a cyclotron diffusion plateau. Our results demonstrate clearly that the field-particle correlation technique can distinguish distinct channels of energy transfer using single-point measurements, even at points in which multiple channels act simultaneously, and can be used to determine quantitatively the rates of particle energization in each channel.},

	abstract = {Abstract The spatial distribution and amplitudes of electron phase space holes observed in the plasma environment near Earth's Moon are presented. When the Moon is in the solar wind, the overwhelming majority of holes in its vicinity occur in its wake, and we attribute them to an instability caused by distortion of the electron distribution by the wake, as predicted by theory. Approximately 30\% of these wake holes are statistically correlated with observed magnetic discontinuities nearby, which implies that external effects can influence and trigger these wake instabilities, yet the wake is the determining factor. When the Moon is deep in the Earth's magnetotail, and no detectable lunar wake is present, the hole occurrence is greatly reduced and is distributed approximately homogeneously about the Moon, implicating a different production mechanism. Near the boundary of the magnetotail, homogeneously occurring holes are more frequent, showing that other instabilities associated with the magnetopause region are also active. These results demonstrate ways in which the Earth's Moon is a unique plasma physics laboratory where plasma wake physics and electron instabilities can be studied in detail.},

	abstract = {This paper describes federated filter applications to integrated, fault-tolerant navigation systems, with emphasis on real-time implementation issues and numerical simulation results. The federated filter is a near-optimal estimator for decentralized, multisensor data fusion. Its partitioned estimation architecture is based on theoretically sound information-sharing principles. It consists of one or more sensor-dedicated local filters, generally operating in parallel, plus a master combining filter. The master filter periodically combines (fuses) the local filter solutions to form the best total solution. Fusion generally occurs at a reduced rate, relative to the local measurement rates. The method can provide significant improvements in fault tolerance, data throughput, and system modularity. Numerical simulation results are presented for an example multisensor navigation system. These results demonstrate federated filter performance characteristics in terms of estimation accuracy, fault tolerance, and computation speed.},

With this Critical Science Plan (CSP) we attempt to anticipate some of what those capabilities will enable, providing a snapshot of some of the scientific pursuits that the DKIST hopes to engage as start-of-operations nears. The work builds on the combined contributions of the DKIST Science Working Group (SWG) and CSP Community members, who generously shared their experiences, plans, knowledge, and dreams.

We discuss the key concepts and physical processes in each growth stage and elaborate on the connections between theoretical studies and observational revelations.

	abstract = {The majority of the transiting planets discovered by the Kepler mission (called super-Earths here, includes the so-called “sub-Neptunes”) orbit close to their stars. As such, photoevaporation of their hydrogen envelopes etches sharp features in an otherwise bland space spanned by planet radius and orbital period. This, in turn, can be exploited to reveal the mass of these planets, in addition to techniques such as radial velocity and transit-timing-variation. Here, using updated radii for Kepler planet hosts from Gaia DR2, I show that the photoevaporation features shift systematically to larger radii for planets around more massive stars (ranging from M-dwarfs to F-dwarfs), corresponding to a nearly linear scaling between planet mass and its host mass. By modeling planet evolution under photoevaporation, one further deduces that the masses of super-Earths peak narrowly around 8 M⊕(M*/M⊙). When such a stellar mass dependence is scaled out, Kepler planets appear to be a homogeneous population surprisingly uniform in mass, in core composition (likely terrestrial), and in initial mass fraction of their H/He envelope (a couple percent). The masses of these planets do not appear to depend on the metallicity values of their host stars, while they may weakly depend on the orbital separation. Taken together, the simplest interpretation of our results is that super-Earths are at the so-called “thermal mass”, where the planet’s Hill radius is equal to the vertical scale height of the gas disk.},

We find that among protoplanets, larger ones grow more slowly than smaller ones, while the growth of protoplanets is still faster than that of planetesimals. As a result, in the stage after rapid runaway growth, protoplanets with the same order mass grow oligarchically, while most planetesimals remain small. While the protoplanets grow, orbital repulsion keeps their orbital separations wider than about 5 Hill radius of the protoplanets. The typical orbital separation is about 10 Hill radius, which only weakly depends on the mass and the semimajor axis of protoplanets. We explain how this self-organized protoplanet–planetesimal system forms.},

	abstract = {A stunning range of substructures in the dust of protoplanetary disks is routinely observed across a range of wavelengths. These gaps, rings and spirals are highly indicative of a population of unseen planets, hinting at the possibility of current observational facilities being able to capture planet-formation in action. Over the last decade, our understanding of the influence of a young planet on the dynamical structure of its parental disk has progressed significantly, revealing a host of potentially observable features which would betray the presence of a deeply embedded planet. In concert, recent observations have shown that subtle perturbations in the kinematic structure of protoplanetary disks are found in multiple sources, potentially the characteristic disturbances associated with embedded planets. In this work, we review the theoretical background of planet-disk interactions, focusing on the kinematical features, and the current methodologies used to observe these interactions in spatially and spectrally resolved observations. We discuss the potential pit falls of such kinematical detections of planets, providing best-practices for imaging and analysing interferometric data, along with a set of criteria to use as a benchmark for any claimed detection of embedded planets. We finish with a discussion on the current state of simulations in regard to planet-disk interactions, highlighting areas of particular interest and future directions which will provide the most significant impact in our search for embedded planets. This work is the culmination of the 'Visualizing the Kinematics of Planet Formation' workshop, held in October 2019 at the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City.},

Turning to solids, I review the evolution of single particles under aerodynamic forces, and describe the conditions necessary for the development of collective gas-particle instabilities. Observations show that disks can exhibit pronounced large-scale structure, and I discuss the types of structures that may form from gas and particle interactions at ice lines, vortices and zonal flows, prior to the formation of large planetary bodies.

We will be mostly concerned with models that aim to fit spectra of the dust continuum or gas lines, and derive physical parameters from these fits. For optically thick disks, these parameters include the accretion rate through the disk onto the star, the geometry of the disk, the dust properties, the surface chemistry and the thermal balance of the gas. For the latter we are mostly concerned with the upper layers of the disk, where the gas and dust temperature decouple and a photoevaporative flow may originate. We also briefly discuss optically thin disks, focusing mainly on the gas, not the dust. The evolution of these disks is dominated by accretion, viscous spreading, photoevaporation, and dust settling and coagulation. The density and temperature structure arising from the surface layer models provide input to models of photoevaporation, which occurs largely in the outer disk. We discuss the consequences of photoevaporation on disk evolution and planet formation.},

This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. We apply the method to announced Kepler planet candidates that transit solar-type stars. The Kepler team's estimates of the detection efficiency are used and are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. The PLDF is fit to a joint power law in planet radius, down to 0.5 R ⊕, and orbital period, up to 50 days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is {\textasciitilde}0.7-1.4, where the range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7 days and between large and small radii at 3 R ⊕. The size distribution changes appreciably between these four samples, revealing a relative deficit of {\textasciitilde}3 R ⊕ planets at the shortest periods. This deficit is suggestive of preferential evaporation and sublimation of Neptune- and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational support of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and would allow refinement of these theories.},

	abstract = {We study dust transport in turbulent protoplanetary disks using three-dimensional global unstratified MHD simulations including Lagrangian dust particles. The turbulence is driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) with either ideal or non-ideal MHD that includes ambipolar diffusion (AD). In ideal MHD simulations, the surface density evolution (except for dust that drifts fastest), turbulent diffusion, and vertical scale height of dust can all be reproduced by simple one-dimensoinal and/or analytical models. However, in AD dominated simulations which simulate protoplanetary disks beyond 10s of AU, the vertical scale height of dust is larger than previously predicted. To understand this anomaly in more detail, we carry out both unstratified and stratified local shearing box simulations with Lagrangian particles, and find that turbulence in AD dominated disks has very different properties (e.g., temporal autocorrelation functions and power spectra) than turbulence in ideal MHD disks, which leads to quite different particle diffusion efficiency. For example, MRI turbulence with AD has a longer correlation time for the vertical velocity, which causes significant vertical particle diffusion and large dust scale height. In ideal MHD the Schmidt numbers (Sc) for radial and vertical turbulent diffusion are and , but in the AD dominated regime both Scr and Scz are . Particle concentration in pressure bumps induced by MRI turbulence has also been studied. Since non-ideal MHD effects dominate most regions in protoplanetary disks, our study suggests that modeling dust transport in turbulence driven by MRI with non-ideal MHD effects is important for understanding dust transport in realistic protoplanetary disks.},

In this brief review, I survey the literature related to ground-based and Spitzer-based infrared (IR) studies of young stellar clusters, with particular emphasis on tracing the evolution of primordial (``protoplanetary'') disks through spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. The available data demonstrate that the fraction of young stars with optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopic evidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decay with characteristic time {\textasciitilde}2.5 Myr (half-life {\textasciitilde}1.7 Myr). Large IR surveys of {\textasciitilde}2-5 Myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatter in the observed disk fractions as a function of age. Recent Spitzer surveys have found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass and environment (binarity, proximity to massive stars, and cluster density). Perhaps most significantly for understanding the planeticity of stars, the disk fraction decay timescale appears to vary by stellar mass, ranging from {\textasciitilde}1 Myr for {\textgreater}1.3 Msolar stars to {\textasciitilde}3 Myr for {\textless}0.08 Msolar brown dwarfs. The exponential decay function may provide a useful empirical formalism for estimating very rough ages for YSO populations and for modeling the effects of disk-locking on the angular momentum of young stars.},

	abstract = {Giant planets are tens to thousands of times as massive as the Earth and many times as large. Most of their volumes are occupied by hydrogen and helium, the primary constituents of the protostellar disks from which they formed. Significantly, the solar system giants are also highly enriched in heavier elements relative to the Sun, indicating that solid material participated in their assembly. Giant planets account for most of the mass of our planetary system and of those extrasolar planetary systems in which they are present. Therefore, giant planets are primary actors in determining the orbital architectures of planetary systems and, possibly, in affecting the composition of terrestrial planets. This chapter describes the principal route that, according to current knowledge, can lead to the formation of giant planets, the core nucleated accretion model, and an alternative route, the disk instability model, which may lead to the formation of planetary-mass objects on wide orbits.},

The period 1956- 1985 includes the first phase of intensive space research; new results from lunar and planetary exploration might be expected to have played a major role in the development of ideas about lunar and planetary formation. While this is indeed the case for theories of the origin of the moon (selenogony), it was not true for the solar system in general, where ground-based observations (including meteorite studies) were frequently more decisive. During this period most theorists accepted a monistic scenario: the collapse of a gas-dust cloud to form the sun with surrounding disk, and condensation of that disk to form planets, were seen as part of a single process. Theorists differed on how to explain the distribution of angular momentum between sun and planets, on whether planets formed directly by condensation of gaseous protoplanets or by accretion of solid planetesimals, on whether the "solar nebula" was ever hot and turbulent enough to vaporize and completely mix its components, and on whether an external cause such as a supernova explosion "triggered" the initial collapse of the cloud. Only in selenogony was a tentative consensus reached on a single working hypothesis with quantitative results.},

	abstract = {We assess whether chondrules, once-molten mm-sized spheres filling the oldest meteorites, could have formed from super-km s-1 collisions between planetesimals in the solar nebula. High-velocity collisions release hot and dense clouds of silicate vapour which entrain and heat chondrule precursors. Thermal histories of CB chondrules are reproduced for colliding bodies ∼10-100 km in radius. The slower cooling rates of non-CB, porphyritic chondrules point to colliders with radii ≳ 500 km. How chondrules, collisionally dispersed into the nebula, agglomerated into meteorite parent bodies remains a mystery. The same orbital eccentricities and inclinations that enable energetic collisions prevent planetesimals from re-accreting chondrules efficiently and without damage; thus the sedimentary laminations of the CB/CH chondrite Isheyevo are hard to explain by direct fallback of collisional ejecta. At the same time, planetesimal surfaces may be littered with the shattered remains of chondrules. The micron-sized igneous particles recovered from comet 81P/Wild-2 may have originated from in-situ collisions and subsequent accretion in the proto-Kuiper belt, obviating the need to transport igneous solids across the nebula. Asteroid sample returns from Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx may similarly contain chondrule fragments.},

The key components describing this process are the relative velocity between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust aggregate collisions.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We present the results of a collision model based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in protoplanetary disks.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We use the results of laboratory experiments to establish the collision model previously published by Güttler et al. The collision model is based on the assumptions that we model the aggregates as spheres with compact and porous “phases” and that there is a continuous transition between these two. We apply this collision model to the Monte Carlo method developed previously by Zsom \& Dullemond and include Brownian motion, radial drift, and turbulence as contributors of relative velocity between dust particles.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU in the midplane for three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles. Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore, we see long-lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the aggregates caused by bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity depend on both the turbulence parameter and the critical mass ratio of dust particles. Upon varying the turbulence parameter, the system behaves in a non-linear way, and we find that the critical mass ratio has a strong effect on the particle sizes and masses. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} during the simulations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is rather insensitive to the variations in the gas density and the strength of turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to {\textless}i{\textgreater}≈{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1 g (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed by the means of the turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted, chondrule-sized particles.},

These dust particles settle into a thin disk which is gravitationally unstable. A first generation of planetesimals, whose radii range up to 10-1 km, form from the dust disk by direct gravitational collapse to solid densities on a time scale of the order of 1 year. The resulting disk, composed of first-generation planetesimals, is still gravitationally unstable, and the planetesimals are grouped into clusters containing approximately 10 members. The contraction of these clusters is controlled by the rate at which gas drag damps their internal rotational and random kinetic energies. On a time scale of a few thousand years, the clusters contract to form a second generation of planetesimals having radii of the order of 5 km. Further coalescence of planetesimals proceeds by direct collisions which seem capable of producing growth at a rate of the order of 15 cm per year at 1 a.u. The final stage of accretion during which planet-sized objects form is not considered here. Subject headings: planets - solar system},

To carry out these studies, we implement and test a particle-mesh self-gravity module for the Athena code that enables the simulation of aerodynamically coupled systems of gas and collisionless self-gravitating solid particles. Upon employment of our algorithm to planetesimal formation simulations, we find that (when a direct comparison is possible) the Athena simulations yield predicted planetesimal properties that agree well with those found in prior work using different numerical techniques. In particular, the gravitational collapse of streaming-initiated clumps leads to an initial planetesimal mass function that is well-represented by a power law, , with , which equates to a differential size distribution of , with . We find no significant trends with resolution from a convergence study of up to 5123 grid zones and particles. Likewise, the power-law slope appears indifferent to changes in the relative strength of self-gravity and tidal shear, and to the time when (for reasons of numerical economy) self-gravity is turned on, though the strength of these claims is limited by small number statistics. For a typically assumed radial distribution of minimum mass solar nebula solids (assumed here to have dimensionless stopping time ), our results support the hypothesis that bodies on the scale of large asteroids or Kuiper Belt Objects could have formed as the high-mass tail of a primordial planetesimal population.},

	abstract = {In protoplanetary disks, solid objects (so-called planetesimals) are formed from dust. Micrometre-sized dust grains grow into millimetre-sized aggregates. Once those aggregates have diameters exceeding a few centimetres, they become subject to concentration mechanisms such as the streaming instability, permitting the formation of self-gravitating clusters, which might eventually collapse into kilometre-sized planetesimals. However, for the streaming instability to set in, clumps spanning sizes from centimetres to decimetres are required in the centre of a protoplanetary disk. In the size range between millimetres and centimetres, aggregates bounce off each other rather than sticking together, and growth is stalled. Here we show in microgravity experiments that collisions between millimetre-sized grains lead to sufficient electrical charging for aggregation to bridge this gap between the bouncing barrier and the onset of the streaming instability. We computationally simulate aggregation and find that models agree with the experimental data only if electrical charging is present. We therefore propose that collisional charging may promote early growth in the size gap that current models of planetesimal formation cannot account for.},

It is the means by which the Sun interacts with planetary magnetospheres and channels charged particles propagating through the heliosphere. As the HMF remains rooted at the solar photosphere as the Sun rotates, the large-scale HMF traces out an Archimedean spiral. This pattern is distorted by the interaction of fast and slow solar wind streams, as well as the interplanetary manifestations of transient solar eruptions called coronal mass ejections. On the smaller scale, the HMF exhibits an array of waves, discontinuities, and turbulence, which give hints to the solar wind formation process. This review aims to summarise observations and theory of the small- and large-scale structure of the HMF. Solar-cycle and cycle-to-cycle evolution of the HMF is discussed in terms of recent spacecraft observations and pre-spaceage proxies for the HMF in geomagnetic and galactic cosmic ray records.},

For each model, we then determined the average coronal field strength, , in approximately 1000 individual flux tubes with regularly spaced footpoints. Scatter plots of versus length, L, are characterized by a flat section for small L and a steeply declining section for large L. They are well described by a function of the form log=C1+C2logL+C3/2log(L2+S2), where C2{\textasciitilde}0, -3{\textless}=C3{\textless}=-1, and 40{\textless}=S{\textless}=240 Mm is related to the characteristic size of the active region. There is a tendency for the magnitude of C3 to decrease as the magnetic complexity of the region increases. The average magnetic energy in a flux tube, 2{\textgreater}, exhibits a similar behavior, with only C3 being significantly different. For flux tubes of intermediate length, 50{\textless}=L{\textless}=300 Mm, corresponding to the soft X-ray loops in a study by Klimchuk \& Porter (1995), we find a universal scaling law of the form {\textasciitilde}Lδ, where δ=-0.88+/-0.3. By combining this with the Klimchuk \& Porter result that the heating rate scales as L-2, we can test different models of coronal heating. We find that models involving the gradual stressing of the magnetic field, by slow footpoint motions, are in generally better agreement with the observational constraints than are wave heating models. We conclude, however, that the theoretical models must be more fully developed and the observational uncertainties must be reduced before any definitive statements about specific heating mechanisms can be made.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02680},
	abstract = {The temperature in most parts of a protoplanetary disk is determined by irradiation from the central star. Numerical experiments of Watanabe {\textbackslash}\& Lin (2008) suggested that such disks, also called `passive disks', suffer from a thermal instability. Here, we use analytical and numerical tools to elucidate the nature of this instability. We find that it is related to the flaring of the optical surface, the layer at which starlight is intercepted by the disk. Whenever a disk annulus is perturbed thermally and acquires a larger scale height, disk flaring becomes steeper in the inner part, and flatter in the outer part. Starlight now shines more overhead for the inner part and so can penetrate into deeper layers; conversely, it is absorbed more shallowly in the outer part. These geometric changes allow the annulus to intercept more starlight, and the perturbation grows. We call this the irradiation instability. It requires only ingredients that are known to exist in realistic disks, and operates best in parts that are both optically thick and geometrically thin (inside 30AU, but can extend to further reaches when, e.g., dust settling is considered). An unstable disk develops travelling thermal waves that reach order-unity in amplitude. In thermal radiation, such a disk should appear as a series of bright rings interleaved with dark shadowed gaps, while in scattered light it resembles a moving staircase. Depending on the gas and dust responses, this instability could lead to a wide range of consequences, such as \{{\textbackslash}w ALMA rings and gaps,\} dust traps, vertical circulation, vortices and turbulence.},

	abstract = {Mass is one of the most fundamental parameters characterizing the dynamics of a coronal mass ejection (CME). It has been found that CME apparent mass measured from the brightness enhancement in coronagraphs increases during its evolution in the corona. However, the physics behind it is not clear. Does the apparent mass gain come from the outflow from the dimming regions in the low corona, or from the pileup of the solar wind plasma around the CME? Here we analyze the mass evolution of six CME events. Based on the coronagraph observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, we find that their masses increased by a factor of 1.3–1.7 from 7 to 15 , where the occulting effect is negligible. We then adopt the “snow-plow” model to calculate the mass contribution of the piled-up solar wind. The result gives evidence that the solar wind pileup probably makes a non-negligible contribution to the mass increase. In the height range from about 7 to 15 , the ratio of the modeled to the measured mass increase is roughly larger than 0.55 though the ratios are believed to be overestimated. It is not clear yet whether the solar wind pileup is a major contributor to the final mass derived from coronagraph observations, but it does play an increasingly important role in the mass increase as a CME moves further away from the Sun.},

For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. She's barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark. But Kya is not what they say. Abandoned at age ten, she has survived on her own in the marsh that she calls home. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life lessons from the land, learning from the false signals of fireflies the real way of this world. But while she could have lived in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world--until the unthinkable happens. In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a heartbreaking coming of age story and a surprising murder investigation. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens's debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps"--},

The dust grains and lunar surface are electrostatically charged by the Moon’s interaction with the local plasma environment and the photoemission of electrons due to solar UV and X-rays. This effect causes the like-charged surface and dust particles to repel each other, and creates a near-surface electric field. Previous models have explained micron-sized dust observed at ∼10cm above the surface, by suggesting that charged grains “levitate” in the local electric field; however this cannot account for observations of 0.1μm-scale grains at ∼100 km altitude. In order to explain the high-altitude dust observations, we propose a dynamic “fountain” model in which charged dust grains follow ballistic trajectories, subsequent to being accelerated upward through a narrow sheath region by the surface electric field. These dust grains could affect the optical quality of the lunar environment for astronomical observations and interfere with exploration activities.},

	abstract = {A recent event study suggested a coupling process whereby suprathermal protons (10–100 eV), as a result of perpendicular heating by pre-existing magnetosonic waves, can excite electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves with frequency near the local proton cyclotron frequency (f{\textasciitilde}0.95fcp). The present study tests this coupling process. First, one-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions/massless fluid electrons) simulations of parallel-propagating EMIC waves initialized with the plasma conditions derived from the event prove that high frequency EMIC waves can be generated by anisotropic suprathermal protons instead of more energetic (10s of keV) ring current protons. Calculation of the quasilinear pitch-angle diffusion coefficient for electrons using the simulated waves suggests that these high frequency EMIC waves outside the plasmasphere can play a role in the pitch-angle scattering of {\textasciitilde}MeV electrons due to the large wavenumber of the excited EMIC waves. Second, the role of the pre-existing magnetosonic waves in the suprathermal proton heating is examined using quasilinear diffusion theory and simple test particle calculation. It is found that the quasilinear diffusion becomes ineffective in energies relevant to the suprathermal protons, indicating that the low-energy ({\textless}10 eV) protons cannot be efficiently energized to the observed level through multi-harmonic cyclotron resonances with the magnetosonic waves observed. Rather, some kind of non-resonant process may have been at play, if the magnetosonic waves were actually involved in the heating. This result suggests that more quantitative understanding of the suggested energy coupling process through magnetosonic waves is needed.},

Solar and Space Physics, from the National Research Council's (NRC's) Committee for a Decadal Strategy in Solar and Space Physics, is the second NRC decadal survey in heliophysics. Building on the research accomplishments realized during the past decade, the report presents a program of basic and applied research for the period 2013-2022 that will improve scientific understanding of the mechanisms that drive the Sun's activity and the fundamental physical processes underlying near-Earth plasma dynamics, determine the physical interactions of Earth's atmospheric layers in the context of the connected Sun-Earth system, and enhance greatly the capability to provide realistic and specific forecasts of Earth's space environment that will better serve the needs of society.
Although the recommended program is directed primarily at NASA and the National Science Foundation for action, the report also recommends actions by other federal agencies, especially the parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration charged with the day-to-day (operational) forecast of space weather. In addition to the recommendations included in this summary, related recommendations are presented in this report.},

	abstract = {Driven by discoveries, and enabled by leaps in technology and imagination, our understanding of the universe has changed dramatically during the course of the last few decades. The fields of astronomy and astrophysics are making new connections to physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. Based on a broad and comprehensive survey of scientific opportunities, infrastructure, and organization in a national and international context, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics outlines a plan for ground- and space- based astronomy and astrophysics for the decade of the 2010's.
Realizing these scientific opportunities is contingent upon maintaining and strengthening the foundations of the research enterprise including technological development, theory, computation and data handling, laboratory experiments, and human resources. New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics proposes enhancing innovative but moderate-cost programs in space and on the ground that will enable the community to respond rapidly and flexibly to new scientific discoveries. The book recommends beginning construction on survey telescopes in space and on the ground to investigate the nature of dark energy, as well as the next generation of large ground-based giant optical telescopes and a new class of space-based gravitational observatory to observe the merging of distant black holes and precisely test theories of gravity.
New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics recommends a balanced and executable program that will support research surrounding the most profound questions about the cosmos. The discoveries ahead will facilitate the search for habitable planets, shed light on dark energy and dark matter, and aid our understanding of the history of the universe and how the earliest stars and galaxies formed. The book is a useful resource for agencies supporting the field of astronomy and astrophysics, the Congressional committees with jurisdiction over those agencies, the scientific community, and the public.},

	abstract = {Smilei is a collaborative, open-source, object-oriented (C++) particle-in-cell code. To benefit from the latest advances in high-performance computing (HPC), Smilei is co-developed by both physicists and HPC experts. The code’s structures, capabilities, parallelization strategy and performances are discussed. Additional modules (e.g. to treat ionization or collisions), benchmarks and physics highlights are also presented. Multi-purpose and evolutive, Smilei is applied today to a wide range of physics studies, from relativistic laser–plasma interaction to astrophysical plasmas.
Program summary
Program title: Smilei (version 3.2) Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/gsn4x6mbrg.1 Licensing provisions: This version of the code is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3 Programming language: C++11, Python 2.7 Nature of the problem: The kinetic simulation of plasmas is at the center of various physics studies, from laser–plasma interaction to astrophysics. To address today’s challenges, a versatile simulation tool requires high-performance computing on massively parallel super-computers. Solution method: The Vlasov–Maxwell system describing the self-consistent evolution of a collisionless plasma is solved using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method. Additional physics modules allow to account for additional effects such as collisions and/or ionization. A hybrid MPI-OpenMP strategy, based on a patch-based super-decomposition, allows for efficient cache-use, dynamic load balancing and high-performance on massively parallel super-computers.

The research has two foci: the direction of the reconnection line in configurations with nonvanishing magnetic fields; and the question why reconnection can be faster if a guide field is added to an otherwise unchanged asymmetric configuration. We find that reconnection prefers a direction, which maximizes the available magnetic energy, and show that this direction coincides with the bisection of the angle between the asymptotic magnetic fields. Regarding the difference in reconnection rates between planar and guide field models, we demonstrate that a guide field can provide essential confinement for particles in the reconnection region, which the weaker magnetic field in one of the inflow directions cannot necessarily provide.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed to study the electromagnetic radiation emitted at the second harmonic 2ω p of the plasma frequency by a weak electron beam propagating in a background plasma with random density fluctuations, in solar wind conditions relevant to Type III solar radio bursts. The dynamics of the waves, the beam, and the plasma are calculated over several thousands of plasma periods. For relevant comparisons, simulations with and without applied density fluctuations are performed for the same parameters. This Letter evidences for the first time the impact of density fluctuations on the physical mechanisms driving the generation of electromagnetic waves emitted at 2ω p . Results obtained show that (i) the beam radiates electromagnetic waves at 2ω p as a result of nonlinear processes of Langmuir waves’ coalescence, despite wave scattering on the density fluctuations that strongly affect the Langmuir spectra; (ii) the fraction of initial beam energy transferred asymptotically to the electromagnetic waves at 2ω p is by one order of magnitude smaller when the plasma involves density fluctuations of average level around 5\%; (iii) compared to the homogeneous case, the ratio of electromagnetic energy radiated at 2ω p to the energy carried by the Langmuir wave turbulence is significantly larger during all the nonlinear stage; (iv) asymptotically, when the plasma is inhomogeneous, electromagnetic emissions at 2ω p present isotropized spectra whereas quadrupolar radiation occurs for the homogeneous plasma case.},

	abstract = {Bodies in space subject to solar ultraviolet flux will emit photoelectrons. At steady state the current of escaping photoelectrons is balanced by an influx of particles from the surrounding plasma. When the photoelectrons dominate the space charge close to the surface, it has previously been shown that two steady state potential distributions can exist, one in which the potential decreases from the surface value to zero monotonically and one in which it decreases to a negative minimum and then increases to zero. It has been suggested that the nonmonotonic distribution is the stable one. By assuming planar geometry and a Maxwellian distribution of the emitted photoelectrons the charging of isolated dust particles in the plasma sheath is calculated for both the monotonic and nonmonotonic potential distribution. By increasing photoemission from the surface from zero a transition from an ordinary Debye sheath above a nonilluminated surface to a photoelectron sheath is simulated. Dynamical properties of the dust particles such as oscillations, damping, stability, and trapping are investigated. After being injected into the sheath or electrostatically levitated, dust may be stably suspended above illuminated surfaces in space, even in the case of zero gravitation. However, the smallest particles may escape completely from the body. For all sheath types an unstable layer exists close to the surface where dust cannot collect. The theory is applied to bodies in the solar wind and to the spokes of Saturn.},

	abstract = {The structure of a gaseous envelope surrounding a protoplanet has been investigated in connection with the formation of the giant planets. Under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, the structure has been calculated for the regions of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Energy transfer in the envelope has been taken into account precisely.When the core mass increases beyond some critical value, the envelope cannot be in hydrostatic equilibrium and collapses onto the core. The most remarkable result is that a common relation between the core mass and the total mass holds irrespectively of the regions in the solar nebula. Therefore, at the collapse, the core mass becomes almost the same regardless of the regions in the nebula. This is consistent with the conclusion obtained from the theory of internal structure of the present giant planets. The grain opacity in the envelope should be about 1cm2/g in order to explain the estimated core mass (about 10 Earth's mass) of the giant planets. The value of the grain opacity is larger than that expected before.},

	abstract = {Observational constraints on interior models of the giant planets indicate that these planets were all much hotter when they formed and they all have rock and/or ice cores of ten to thirty earth masses. These cores are probably soluble in the envelopes above, especially in Jupiter and Saturn, and are therefore likely to be primordial. They persist despite the continual upward mixing by thermally driven convection throughout the age of the solar system, because of the inefficiency of double-diffusive convection. Thus, these planets most probably formed by the hydrodynamic collapse of a gaseous envelope onto a core rather than by direct instability of the gaseous solar nebula. Recent calculations by Mizuno (1980, Prog. Theor. Phys. 64, 544) show that this formation mechanism may explain the similarity of giant planet core masses. Problems remain however, and no current model is entirely satisfactory in explaining the properties of the giant planets and simultaneously satisfying the terrestrial planet constraints. Satellite systematics and protoplanetary disk nebulae are also discussed and related to formation conditions.},

	abstract = {The observed properties of giant planets, models of their evolution, and observations of protoplanetary disks provide constraints on the formation of gas giant planets. The four largest planets in our solar system contain considerable quantities of hydrogen and helium; these gases could not have condensed into solid planetesimals within the protoplanetary disk. Jupiter and Saturn are mostly hydrogen and helium, but have larger abundances of heavier elements than does the Sun. Neptune and Uranus are primarily composed of heavier elements. The transiting extrasolar planet HD149026b, which is slightly more massive than Saturn, appears to have comparable amounts of light gases and heavy elements. The other observed transiting exoplanets are primarily hydrogen and helium, but may contain supersolar abundances of heavy elements. Spacecraft flybys and observations of satellite orbits provide estimates of the gravitational moments of the giant planets in our solar system, which in turn provide information on the internal distribution of matter within Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Atmospheric thermal structure and heat flow measurements constrain the interior temperatures of these planets. Internal processes may cause giant planets to become more compositionally differentiated or alternatively more homogeneous; high-pressure laboratory experiments provide data useful for modeling these processes. The preponderance of evidence supports the core nucleated gas accretion model. According to this model, giant planets begin their growth by the accumulation of small solid bodies, as do terrestrial planets. However, unlike terrestrial planets, the giant planet cores grow massive enough to accumulate substantial amounts of gas before the protoplanetary disk dissipates. The primary question regarding the core nucleated growth model is under what conditions can planets develop cores sufficiently massive to accrete gas envelopes within the lifetimes of gaseous protoplanetary disks.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we will deal with the discovery of the first extrasolar planets around normal stars. This discovery took place in the mid-1990s thanks to the analysis of periodic Doppler shifts in stellar spectra and turned out to be a landmark achievement, in that it established a new field of research that is growing at full speed since then, and at the same time, it answered a question – do other worlds exist in the cosmos? – that dates back to ancient times. This major result was made possible by the impressive improvement in Doppler analysis techniques during the second half of the twentieth century, until the precision boosted to values suitable to detect massive planets in close-in orbits. In the late 1980s, two objects came to the limelight: HD 114762 b and γ Cep b. They were suspected to be exoplanets, but it was not possible to rule out alternative explanations, so no undisputable discovery could be claimed. A few years later, in 1995, the discovery of 51 Peg b was announced and confirmed as the first secure one. However, the features of this planet were quite weird as compared to those of the planets of the Solar System, as it was massive and very close to its parent star. Its discovery overturned the previously widespread idea that other systems had to be made like ours and opened the floodgates to the spotting of many other planets. In this chapter, we will tell this story, mainly dwelling upon the historical and epistemological aspects.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters, giant extrasolar planets with orbital periods shorter than ∼10 days, have long been thought to form at large radial distances, only to subsequently experience long-range inward migration. Here, we offer the contrasting view that a substantial fraction of the hot Jupiter population formed in situ via the core-accretion process. We show that under conditions appropriate to the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, rapid gas accretion can be initiated by super-Earth-type planets, comprising 10–20 Earth masses of refractory material. An in situ formation scenario leads to testable consequences, including the expectation that hot Jupiters should frequently be accompanied by additional low-mass planets with periods shorter than ∼100 days. Our calculations further demonstrate that dynamical interactions during the early stages of planetary systems’ lifetimes should increase the inclinations of such companions, rendering transits rare. High-precision radial velocity monitoring provides the best prospect for their detection.},

For Uranus and Neptune we find deep envelope metallicities up to 0.95, perhaps indicating the existence of an eroded core, as also supported by their low luminosity. We discuss the results of simple cooling models of our solar system’s planets, and show that more complex thermal evolution models may be necessary to understand their cooling history. We review how measurements of the masses and radii of the nearly 50 transiting extrasolar giant planets are changing our understanding of giant planets. In particular a fraction of these planets appear to be larger than can be accommodated by standard models of planetary contraction. We review the proposed explanations for the radii of these planets. We also discuss very young giant planets, which are being directly imaged with ground- and space-based telescopes.},

The resulting equation of state (EOS) implies that Jupiter possesses a central core of 14-18 Earth masses of heavier elements, a result that supports core accretion as the standard model for the formation of hydrogen-rich giant planets. Our nominal model has about 4 Earth masses of planetary ices in the H-He-rich mantle, a result that is, within a modeling uncertainty of 6 Earth masses, consistent with abundances measured by the 1995 Galileo entry probe mission, suggesting that the composition found by the probe may be representative of the entire planet. Interior models derived from this first-principles EOS do not give a match to Jupiter's gravity moment J4 unless one invokes interior differential rotation, implying that Jovian interior dynamics has an observable effect on the high-order gravity field.},

We use structural evolution models to infer the amount of heavy elements within each of these planets. There is a correlation between the stellar metallicity and the mass of heavy elements in its transiting planet(s). It appears that all giant planets possess a minimum of {\textasciitilde}10-15 Earth masses of heavy elements, with planets around metal-rich stars having larger heavy-element masses. There is also an inverse relationship between the mass of the planet and the metal enrichment (Z pl/Z star), which appears to have little dependency on the metallicity of the star. Saturn- and Jupiter-like enrichments above solar composition are a hallmark of all the gas giants in the sample, even planets of several Jupiter masses. These relationships provide an important constraint on planet formation and suggest large amounts of heavy elements within planetary H/He envelopes. We suggest that the observed correlation can soon also be applied to inflated planets, such that the interior heavy-element abundance of these planets could be estimated, yielding better constraints on their interior energy sources. We point to future directions for planetary population synthesis models and suggest future correlations. This appears to be the first evidence that extrasolar giant planets, as a class, are enhanced in heavy elements.},

	abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density (σinit) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that σinit≈ 10 g cm−2near Jupiter's orbit and that σinit∝a−2, whereais the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the “minimum-mass” solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.},

We apply a nested-grid technique to resolve the thermodynamics of the disk at the orbital-radius length scale and that of the envelope at the core-radius length scale. The gas is modeled as a solar mixture of molecular and atomic hydrogen, helium, and their ions. The equation of state accounts for both gas and radiation, and gas energy includes contributions from rotational and vibrational states of molecular hydrogen and from ionization of atomic species. Dust opacities are computed from first principles, applying the full Mie theory. One-dimensional (1D) calculations of planet formation are used to supplement the 3D calculations by providing energy deposition rates in the envelope due to solids accretion. We compare 1D and 3D envelopes and find that masses and gas accretion rates agree within factors of 2, and so do envelope temperatures. The trajectories of passive tracers are used to define the size of 3D envelopes, resulting in radii much smaller than the Hill radius and smaller than the Bondi radius. The moments of inertia and angular momentum of the envelopes are determined and the rotation rates are derived from the rigid-body approximation, resulting in slow bulk rotation. We find that the polar flattening is {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.05. The dynamics of the accretion flow are examined by tracking the motion of tracers that move into the envelope. The anisotropy of this flow is characterized in terms of both its origin and impact site at the envelope surface. Gas merges with the envelope preferentially at mid- to high latitudes.},

In contrast to earlier calculations which assume that protoplanets are isolated, this study invokes a time-dependent surface boundary condition that simulates physical conditions in an evolving primitive solar nebula. In a first set of calculations the protoplanet is surrounded by a "thermal bath" whose temperature varies with time and whose pressure is small and constant in time. Under a wide range of parameters the result is evaporation and complete dispersal of the object. Conditions required for the protoplanet to survive are discussed. In a second set of calculations both the temperature and pressure at the surface vary with time according to models of the solar nebula. In this case the protoplanet is not dispersed, but the evolution is accelerated or retarded relative to that of an isolated protoplanet, depending upon whether the entropy in the nebula is lower than or higher than, respectively, the entropy in the outer layers of the protoplanet. Processes by which terrestrial planets can form in the cores of giant gaseous protoplanets are discussed.},

	abstract = {High-contrast adaptive optics (AO) imaging is a powerful technique to probe the architectures of planetary systems from the outside-in and survey the atmospheres of self-luminous giant planets. Direct imaging has rapidly matured over the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of high-order AO systems, dedicated planet-finding instruments with specialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing strategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results, discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical overview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on observations of 384 unique and single young (≈5-300 Myr) stars spanning stellar masses between 0.1 and 3.0 M ⊙, the overall occurrence rate of 5-13 M Jup companions at orbital distances of 30-300 au is \{0.6\}-0.5+0.7 \% assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive giant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot Jupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual stellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically significant trend in planet frequency with host mass: giant planets are found around \{2.8\}-2.3+3.7 \% of BA stars, {\textless}4.1\% of FGK stars, and {\textless}3.9\% of M dwarfs. Looking forward, extreme AO systems and the next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection limits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics, composition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses and ages.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the question of the large-scale gravitational stability of an arbitrary, highly flattened stellar system, which is assumed initially to rotate in approximate equilibrium between its self-gravitation and the centrifugal forces. It is concluded that no such disk, if fairly smooth or uniform, can be entirely stable against a tendency to form massive condensations within its own plane, unless the root-mean-square random velocities of its constituents, in the directions parallel to that plane, are everywhere sufficiently large. Lacking such random motions, it is shown that the system must be vulnerable to numerous unstable disturbances, the dimensions of which may approach its over-all radius, and whose times of growth are to be reckoned in fractions of the typical periods of revolution. The minimum root-mean-square radial velocity dispersion required in any one vicinity for the complete suppression of all axisymmetric instabilities is calculated (in collaboration with A. Kalnajs) as 3.36 G /K, where G is the gravitational constant, and and K are the local values of the projected stellar density and the epicyclic frequency, respectively. From that, and the observed j\# and K, together with their uncertainties, this minimum for the solar neighborhood of our Galaxy is estimated to fall between 20 and 35 k /sec, a range which indeed encompasses the actual radial velocity dispersions of the most predominant types of stars in our vicinity. It is pointed out that both this curious agreement, and also the well-known discrepancy between the z- and r-velocity dispersions at least of the older disk stars, may be explainable in terms of past instabilities of this galactic disk.},

In my opinion, exciting discoveries and theoretical advances will continue indefinitely in the years ahead, albeit at a slower pace than in the first decade. The reason is that observations uncover new kinds and new populations of exoplanets -- and these observations rely on technological development that usually takes over a decade to mature. For example, in the early 2000s all but one exoplanet was discovered by the radial velocity technique. At that time, many groups around the world were working on wide-field transit surveys. But it was not until recently, a decade into the twenty-first century, that the transit technique is responsible for almost one-quarter of known exoplanets. The planet discovery techniques astrometry (as yet to find a planet) and direct imaging have not yet matured; when they do, they will uncover planets within a new parameter space of planet mass and orbital characteristics. In addition, people are working hard to improve the precision for existing planet discovery techniques to detect lower-mass planets and those further from the star. All in all, technology enables slow but sure progress, and this fuels ongoing discovery. Theory, like observations, also takes time to unfold and mature. We can anticipate an "ultimate" planet formation model similar to the "millenimum simulation" for galaxy formation and evolution. In time, incorporating detailed physics as well as being able to reproduce the generic outcome of planet populations (mass, radius, and orbital characteristics, including period) will enable a deeper understanding of planet formation and migration. Similarly, the ideal exoplanet atmosphere code of the future could be a three-dimensional Monte Carlo code that includes radiative transfer with inhomogeneous cloud coverage and surface features, a code that also solves for the temperature structure and combines with a hydrodynamical simulation to calculate the three-dimensional temperature and wind structure. Classical orbital mechanics, already reinvigorated by interesting exoplanet systems (e.g., planets in resonant orbits, hot Jupiter exoplanets that orbit in the direction opposite to the stellar rotation), also has a role to play in explaining fundamental mechanisms of how planetary system configurations came to be. Orbital dynamics modeling is driving the search for moons and other unseen planet companions by their perturbations on transiting planet signatures. Exoplanets is a unique science because it involves so many disciplines within and beyond planetary science and astrophysics. The other disciplines include geophysics, high-pressure mineral physics, quantum mechanics, chemistry, and even microbiology. While exoplanet observations clearly belong under the branch of astronomy, for many years the whole discipline of exoplanets lacked a true home. Physics departments have said "Exoplanets: It's interesting, but is it physics?" Planetary and Earth science departments used to collecting real data in their hands from Earth and in situ measurements from solar system planets were, in the early 2000s, reluctant to believe there would ever be enough high-quality data to take the research field of exoplanets seriously. With hundreds of known exoplanets and many fascinating observational and theoretical discoveries, the whole world is embracing exoplanets, a field that can now find its home both in and spanning across planetary science, astronomy and astrophysics, and astrobiology. We use the term "exoplanets" and not "extrasolar planets" in this book. Exoplanets is the most direct derivative from the Greek language, from which the word "planet" originates. (Note that the word "extrasolar" is derived from Latin.) It is most fitting that the field be named as traditionally as possible, and there is none more traditional than Greek. The goal of this volume is to cover the range of topics in exoplanet observation and theory at the graduate student level. Each chapter of this volume aims to cover the fundamentals and recent discoveries in such a way as to be a cross between a textbook and a review article. Because the field of exoplanets moves so rapidly, we have tried to arrange each chapter so that the first two sections (the introduction and and an explanation of the basic concepts/fundamental equations) will not go out of date. The next two sections (covering recent highlights and future progress) will go out of date eventually, but serve to capture and review what is going on in a subfield. Some chapters deviate from the standard structure and, by nature of construction, the level of technical detail and writing style will vary in an edited volume with different authors for each chapter. We intend that this book will serve to inspire professional researchers and engineers and students to build a foundation for the next generation of exoplanet observational and theoretical discoveries. Exoplanets is the 37th book in the University of Arizona Press Space Science Series, the first dedicated to planets beyond our solar system. As editor of this volume, I foremost thank General Editor Richard Binzel for believing in my vision for this book and for his advice and fast turnaround on practical matters. I am extremely grateful to Renée Dotson of the Lunar and Planetary Institute for her patience and careful efforts in compiling and production of the book. The book would not have been possible without the contribution and dedication of each of the chapter authors, often going far beyond what the authors had initially anticipated. The chapter reviewers played an invaluable role in improving the quality of this book. Appreciation to William Hartmann for his original painting that graces the book's cover. Last but not least, I am grateful to Wes Traub of NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for his financial support, which has enabled the book to be available for a practical purchase price. Close to two decades since the first exoplanets were discovered, the field of exoplanets has grown without bound. So many surprising discoveries have been made that by now we know to expect the unexpected. I always like to say that, for exoplanets, anything is possible within the laws of physics and chemistry. And, when asked about which planet or discovery is my favorite one, I like to reply that it is the next one, because in exoplanets, the best is yet to come. I hope you, the reader, will use this book to learn about whichever subdiscipline interests you and to build your knowledge to play a role in the future of exoplanet research.},

This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form ρ=ρ0+cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5\% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with {\textasciitilde}5\% uncertainty water ice planets with {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}25\% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state.

	abstract = {We model the growth of Jupiter via core nucleated accretion, applying constraints from hydrodynamical processes that result from the disk-planet interaction. We compute the planet's internal structure using a well tested planetary formation code that is based upon a Henyey-type stellar evolution code. The planet's interactions with the protoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-D hydrodynamic simulations. Previous models of Jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to be approximately one Hill sphere radius, R. However, 3-D hydrodynamic simulations show that only gas within ∼0.25R remains bound to the planet, with the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of the protoplanetary disk. Therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outer boundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reach the portion of the flow not bound to the planet. We find that the smaller radius increases the time required for planetary growth by ∼5\%. Thermal pressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times as massive as Earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereas hydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. Within a moderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass is about equal to the mass of Saturn. In a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limits to accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. Observations suggest that the typical lifetime of massive disks around young stellar objects is ∼3 Myr. To account for the dissipation of such disks, we perform some of our simulations of Jupiter's growth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on this timescale. In all of the cases that we simulate, the planet's effective radiating temperature rises to well above 1000 K soon after hydrodynamic limits begin to control the rate of gas accretion and the planet's distended envelope begins to contract. According to our simulations, proto-Jupiter's distended and thermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's current retinue of irregular satellites as advocated by Pollack et al.

We discuss the wide range of calculations undertaken by ourselves and others using various numerical techniques, and we report preliminary results from a large multicode collaboration.

	abstract = {Star and planet formation are the complex outcomes of gravitational collapse and angular momentum transport mediated by protostellar and protoplanetary disks. In this review, we focus on the role of gravitational instability in this process. We begin with a brief overview of the observational evidence for massive disks that might be subject to gravitational instability and then highlight the diverse ways in which the instability manifests itself in protostellar and protoplanetary disks: the generation of spiral arms, small-scale turbulence-like density fluctuations, and fragmentation of the disk itself. We present the analytic theory that describes the linear growth phase of the instability supplemented with a survey of numerical simulations that aim to capture the nonlinear evolution. We emphasize the role of thermodynamics and large-scale infall in controlling the outcome of the instability. Despite apparent controversies in the literature, we show a remarkable level of agreement between analytic predictions and numerical results. In the next part of our review, we focus on the astrophysical consequences of the instability. We show that the disks most likely to be gravitationally unstable are young and relatively massive compared with their host star, M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≥0.1. They will develop quasi-stable spiral arms that process infall from the background cloud. Although instability is less likely at later times, once infall becomes less important, the manifestations of the instability are more varied. In this regime, the disk thermodynamics, often regulated by stellar irradiation, dictates the development and evolution of the instability. In some cases the instability may lead to fragmentation into bound companions. These companions are more likely to be brown dwarfs or stars than planetary mass objects. Finally, we highlight open questions related to the development of a turbulent cascade in thin disks and the role of mode-mode coupling in setting the maximum angular momentum transport rate in thick disks.},

It is now well established that fragmentation occurs if the disc is cooled on a time-scale smaller than the local dynamical time-scale, while for longer cooling times the disc reaches a quasi-steady state in thermal equilibrium, with the cooling rate balanced by the heating due to gravitational stresses. We investigate here how the fragmentation boundary depends on the assumed equation of state. We find that the cooling time required for fragmentation increases as the specific heat ratio γ decreases, exceeding the local dynamical time-scale for γ= 7/5. This result can be easily interpreted as a consequence of there being a maximum stress (in units of the local disc pressure) that can be sustained by a self-gravitating disc in quasi-equilibrium. Fragmentation occurs if the cooling time is such that the stress required to reach thermal equilibrium exceeds this value, independent of γ. This result suggests that a quasi-steady, self-gravitating disc can never produce a stress that results in the viscous α parameter exceeding {\textasciitilde}0.06.},

Here we critically revise its viability by noting that to form planets directly, it is not enough for protoplanetary disks to be gravitationally unstable. They must also be able to cool efficiently (on a timescale comparable to the local disk orbital period) to allow the formation of the bound clumps by fragmentation. A combination of the dynamical and thermal constraints puts very stringent lower limits on the properties of disks capable of fragmenting into the self-gravitating objects: for the gravitational instability to form giant planets at 10 AU in the disk cooled by the radiation transfer, the gas temperature must exceed 103 K with a minimum disk mass of 0.7 Msolar and a luminosity of 40 Lsolar. Although these requirements are relaxed in the more distant parts of the disk, masses of the bound objects formed as a result of instability are too large even at 100 AU ({\textasciitilde}10MJ) to explain the characteristics of known extrasolar giant planets. Such protoplanetary disks (and planets formed in them) have very unusual observational properties, and this severely constrains the possibility of giant planet formation by direct gravitational instability.},

	abstract = {Recently, the gravitational instability (GI) model of giant planet and brown dwarf formation has been revisited and recast into what is often referred to as the `tidal downsizing' hypothesis. The fragmentation of self-gravitating protostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to tens of Jupiter masses, at semimajor axes above 30-40 au - is followed by a combination of grain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central star and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the resultant object depends sensitively on the time-scales upon which each process occurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce objects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets and brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what proportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more involved statistical analysis. We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation via GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar disc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass, grain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption. While there are key pieces of physics yet to be incorporated, it represents a first step towards a mature statistical model of GI and tidal downsizing as a mode of star and planet formation. We show results from four runs of the population synthesis model, varying the opacity law and the strength of migration, as well as investigating the effect of disc truncation during the fragmentation process. We find that a large fraction of disc fragments are completely destroyed by tidal disruption (typically 40 per cent of the initial population). The tidal downsizing process tends to prohibit low-mass embryos reaching small semimajor axis. The majority of surviving objects are brown dwarfs without solid cores of any kind. Around 40 per cent of surviving objects form solid cores of the order of 5-10 M⊕, and of this group a few do migrate to distances amenable to current exoplanet observations. Over a million disc fragments were simulated in this work, and only one resulted in the formation of a terrestrial planet (i.e. with a core mass of a few Earth masses and no gaseous envelope). These early results suggest that GI followed by tidal downsizing is not the principal mode of planet formation, but remains an excellent means of forming gas giant planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars at large semimajor axes.},

	abstract = {We investigate the role of magnetic fields in the fragmentation of self-gravitating discs using 3D global ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the PHANTOM smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. For initially toroidal fields, we find two regimes. In the first, where the cooling time is greater than five times the dynamical time, magnetic fields reduce spiral density wave amplitudes, which in turn suppresses fragmentation. This is the case even if the magnetic pressure is only a 10th of the thermal pressure. The second regime occurs when the cooling time is sufficiently short that magnetic fields cannot halt fragmentation. We find that magnetized discs produce more massive fragments, due to both the additional pressure exerted by the magnetic field and the additional angular momentum transport induced by Maxwell stresses. The fragments are confined to a narrower range of initial semimajor axes than those in unmagnetized discs. The orbital eccentricity and inclination distributions of unmagnetized and magnetized disc fragments are similar. Our results suggest that the fragmentation boundary could be at cooling times a factor of 2 lower than predicted by purely hydrodynamical models.},

As a result, models are not uniquely constrained by measured gravitational multiple coefficients. Further uncertainty is associated with the effect of a multiplicity of rotation periods due to zonal flows of unknown magnitude and depth (and therefore unknown mass). Nevertheless, the inference that Saturn has a large core of mass 15–20 M e (Earth masses) is robust. The equation of state of dense hydrogen—helium mixtures is one area where uncertainty has been much reduced, thanks to new first-principles simulations. However, because there is still uncertainty in Saturn's interior temperature profile, a variety of mantle metallicities and core masses could still fit the constraints, and the question of interior helium separation is still unsettled.},

Disk instability and core accretion models have been proposed for Saturn’s formation, but core accretion is favored on the basis of its volatile abundances, internal structure, hydrodynamic models, chemical characteristics of protoplanetary disk, etc. The observed frequency, properties, and models of exoplanets provide additional supporting evidence for core accretion. The heavy elements with mass greater than 4He make up the core of Saturn, but are presently poorly constrained, except for carbon. The C/H ratio is super-solar, and twice that in Jupiter. The enrichment of carbon and other heavy elements in Saturn and Jupiter requires special delivery mechanisms for volatiles to these planets. In this chapter we will review our current understanding of the origin and evolution of Saturn and its atmosphere, using a multifaceted approach that combines diverse sets of observations on volatile composition and abundances, relevant properties of the moons and rings, comparison with the other gas giant planet, Jupiter, and analogies to the extrasolar giant planets, as well as pertinent theoretical models.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the formation of gaseous envelopes of giant planets with wide ranges of parameters through quasi-static evolutionary simulations. In the nucleated instability model, rapid gas accretion is triggered when the solid core mass exceeds a critical mass. The gas accretion should be regulated essentially by core accretion rate and grain opacity in the outermost envelope. The conventional critical core mass {\textasciitilde}5-20 M⊕ (M⊕: Earth's mass), however, is based on some nominal values of these quantities. The discovery of extrasolar giant planets requires investigation of the gas accretion processes under various circumstances. Furthermore, the current planetary accretion theory points out that the cores of Jupiter and Saturn would have been isolated from planetesimals and the core accretion would have almost stopped in their later stage of formation before their masses reached the conventional critical core mass. Through numerical simulations of quasi-static evolution of the gaseous envelope, we have investigated the characteristic growth times of the envelope mass for wide ranges of core accretion rate and grain opacity. We also studied the case where core accretion stops before onset of rapid gas accretion. Our main results are (1) the growth time of the envelope mass τg depends strongly on the core mass, moderately on the grain opacity, and weakly on the past core accretion process, and (2) τg is expressed approximately as τg{\textasciitilde}108(Mcore /M⊕)-2.5(κ gr/1 cm 2 g-1) yr, where Mcore is the core mass and κgr is the grain opacity. Our results combined with the recent planetary accretion theory suggest surface density of solid materials twice as massive as that of the minimum-mass solar nebula model and the longer lifetime of the nebula than the 108 yr needed to form Jupiter and Saturn; otherwise migration of protoplanets may have to be considered. Our extensive parametric study not only confirms the difficulty in the formation of the giant planets quantitatively and rigorously, it also gives essential information in considering the problem of the formation, which is quite useful in applications.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations, based on the core-nucleated accretion model, are presented for the formation of Jupiter at 5.2 AU in three primordial disks with three different assumed values of the surface density of solid particles. The grain opacities in the envelope of the protoplanet are computed using a detailed model that includes settling and coagulation of grains and that incorporates a recalculation of the grain size distribution at each point in time and space. We generally find lower opacities than the 2\% of interstellar values used in previous calculations (Hubickyj, O., Bodenheimer, P., Lissauer, J.J. [2005]. Icarus 179, 415-431; Lissauer, J.J., Hubickyj, O., D'Angelo, G., Bodenheimer, P. [2009]. Icarus 199, 338-350). These lower opacities result in more rapid heat loss from and more rapid contraction of the protoplanetary envelope. For a given surface density of solids, the new calculations result in a substantial speedup in formation time as compared with those previous calculations. Formation times are calculated to be 1.0, 1.9, and 4.0 Myr, and solid core masses are found to be 16.8, 8.9, and 4.7 M⊕, for solid surface densities, σ, of 10, 6, and 4 g cm -2, respectively. For σ = 10 and σ = 6 g cm -2, respectively, these formation times are reduced by more than 50\% and more than 80\% compared with those in a previously published calculation with the old approximation to the opacity.},

	abstract = {"The 20th Century Art Book" was hailed upon its release as an exciting celebration of the myriad forms assumed by art over the last century. Complementing the phenomenally successful "Art Book", and most recently "The American Art Book", it presents a new and original way of bringing art alive. Covering the truly international nature of the modern art scene, it encompasses established, iconic works of art and the classics of the future. 500 artists are showcased in alphabetical order, each represented by a full-page colour plate of a definitive work and an incisive text which sheds light on both image and creator. This book is above all easy to use: cross-references help the reader make connections between artists; there is a jargon-free glossary of artistic terms and movements; and an international directory of museums and galleries lists the works on public view. Ideal for those approaching the subject for the first time, it is a fun and unintimidating look at the ever-expanding boundaries of art.},

Machine learning models are often built from the collected data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of future events. Due to bandwidth, storage, and privacy concerns, it is often impractical to send all the data to a centralized location. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent-based approaches. We analyze the convergence bound of distributed gradient descent from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm that determines the best tradeoff between local update and global parameter aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments with real datasets, both on a networked prototype system and in a larger-scale simulated environment. The experimentation results show that our proposed approach performs near to the optimum with various machine learning models and different data distributions.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via adversarial nets, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples.},

Direct measurement of the travel times and distances of individual acoustic waves—the predominant approach in terrestrial seismology3—would appear to be more difficult in view of the number and stochastic nature of solar seismic sources. Here, however, we show that it is possible to extract time-distance information from temporal cross-correlations of the intensity fluctuations on the solar surface. This approach opens the way for seismic studies of local solar phenomena, such as subsurface in homogeneities near sunspots, and should help to refine global models of the internal velocity stratification in the Sun.},

This lunar soil consists of highly angular particles in a broad, approximately power law size distribution, with impact-generated glasses. The regolith becomes densified and difficult to excavate when subjected to lunar quakes or, eventually, manned and unmanned activity on the surface. Solar radiation and the solar wind produce a plasma sheath near the lunar surface. Lunar grains acquire charge in this environment and can exhibit unusual behavior, including levitation and transport across the surface because of electric fields in the plasma sheath. The fine component of the lunar regolith contributes to the operational and health hazards posed to planned lunar expeditions. In this paper we discuss the mechanical response of the regolith to anticipated exploration activities and review the plasma environment near the lunar surface and the observations, models, and dynamics of charged lunar dust.},

By repositioning two of the five THEMIS probes (P1 and P2) in coordinated, lunar equatorial orbits, at distances of ∼55–65 REgeocentric (∼1.1–12 RLselenocentric), ARTEMIS will perform the first systematic, two-point observations of the distant magnetotail, the solar wind, and the lunar space and planetary environment. The primary heliophysics science objectives of the mission are to study from such unprecedented vantage points and inter-probe separations how particles are accelerated at reconnection sites and shocks, and how turbulence develops and evolves in Earth’s magnetotail and in the solar wind. Additionally, the mission will determine the structure, formation, refilling, and downstream evolution of the lunar wake and explore particle acceleration processes within it. ARTEMIS’s orbits and instrumentation will also address key lunar planetary science objectives: the evolution of lunar exospheric and sputtered ions, the origin of electric fields contributing to dust charging and circulation, the structure of the lunar interior as inferred by electromagnetic sounding, and the lunar surface properties as revealed by studies of crustal magnetism. ARTEMIS is synergistic with concurrent NASA missions LRO and LADEE and the anticipated deployment of the International Lunar Network. It is expected to be a key element in the NASA Heliophysics Great Observatory and to play an important role in international plans for lunar exploration.},

In this paper, we compare LP ER measurements with one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of the potential above the lunar surface when the Moon is exposed to both solar UV radiation and the terrestrial plasma sheet. The simulations show that large negative potentials will be measured by LP ER due to the presence of stable, non-monotonic potentials.

	abstract = {As an airless body in space with no global magnetic field, the Moon is exposed to both solar ultraviolet radiation and ambient plasmas. Photoemission from solar UV radiation and collection of ambient plasma are typically opposing charging currents and simple charging current balance predicts that the lunar dayside surface should charge positively; however, the two ARTEMIS probes have observed energy-dependent loss cones and high-energy, surface-originating electron beams above the dayside lunar surface for extended periods in the magnetosphere, which are indicative of negative surface potentials. In this paper, we compare observations by the ARTEMIS P1 spacecraft with a one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation and show that the energy-dependent loss cones and electron beams are due to the presence of stable, non-monotonic, negative potentials above the lunar surface. The simulations also show that while the magnitude of the non-monotonic potential is mainly driven by the incoming electron temperature, the incoming ion temperature can alter this magnitude, especially for periods in the plasma sheet when the ion temperature is more than twenty times the electron temperature. Finally, we note several other plasma phenomena associated with these non-monotonic potentials, such as broadband electrostatic noise and electron cyclotron harmonic emissions, and offer possible generation mechanisms for these phenomena.},

	abstract = {Long before the advent of spaceflight, it was realized that space is not empty. The Universe hosts a harsh plasma environment and understandingthe complex interactions of bodies immersed in it is therefore indispensable to make progress in space science, especially with the eye of society looking ever further into and beyond our Solar system. In this thesis, we focus on three important topics in the field of space plasma physics connected through their need for detailed simulation studies. First, we present the initial results of a comparative performance studybetween the new Intel Xeon-Phi (MIC) architecture, the Intel Xeon (Sandy Bridge, SB) and a Nvidia graphical processing unit (GPU) running CUDA,for which we use a 1-D explicit electrostatic Vlasov-Ampère particle-in-cell code. Computing times and speedup of the code for the three different architectures are compared for various number of cores/threadsand compiler options. We find that the GPU consistently obtains shortercomputing times than both the MIC and SB architectures for an increasing numbers of threads as well as better scaling. At this stage, then, we have to conclude that the GPU out-performs the MIC in terms of speed. Secondly, the full-kinetic implicit multi-scale plasma simulation code iPic3D is adapted for the analysis of solar wind-spacecraft interactions. We successfully implement a suitable electrostatic solver to enclose the immersed boundary algorithm and create the possibility to handle complex spacecraft geometries. Additionally we discuss a cross-comparison of spacecraft-environment interaction model predictions from five different spacecraft-plasma codes applied to a simplified geometry of the Solar Probe Plus (SPP) spacecraft near perihelion, predicting that SPP will operate in a saturated emission regime with a negative floating potential Φ ≈ −10 V. Last but not least, we present the first three-dimensional full-kinetic and electromagnetic simulations of the solar wind interaction with Lunar crustal magnetic anomalies (LMAs). We confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly impacting the Lunar surface forming a so-called ‘mini-magnetosphere’, as suggested by spacecraft observations and theory. We develop electromagnetic open boundary conditions and, studying in detail the field structure and particle dynamics, we show that the LMA configuration is driven by electron motion because its scale size is small with respect to the gyroradius of the solar wind ions. We identify a population of backstreaming ions, the deflection of magnetized electrons viathe E × B drift motion and the subsequent formation of a halo region ofelevated density around the dipole source. Finally, it is shown that the presence and efficiency of the latter mechanisms are heavily impacted by the upstream plasma conditions and, on their turn, influence the overall structure and evolution of the LMA system. Each of the subjects discussed in this work extends our current scientific knowledge and helps pave the way to new and exciting research and to future human exploration on and beyond our precious planet.},

In contrast to earlier magnetohydrodynamics and hybrid simulations, the fully kinetic nature of iPic3D allows us to investigate the space charge effects and in particular the electron dynamics dominating the near-surface lunar plasma environment. We describe for the first time the interaction of a dipole model centered just below the lunar surface under plasma conditions such that only the electron population is magnetized. The fully kinetic treatment identifies electromagnetic modes that alter the magnetic field at scales determined by the electron physics. Driven by strong pressure anisotropies, the mini-magnetosphere is unstable over time, leading to only temporal shielding of the surface underneath. Future human exploration as well as lunar science in general therefore hinges on a better understanding of LMAs.},

	abstract = {We present a general model of the solar wind interaction with a dipolar lunar crustal magnetic anomaly (LMA) using three-dimensional full-kinetic and electromagnetic simulations. We confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly impacting the lunar surface, forming a so-called “minimagnetosphere,” as suggested by spacecraft observations and theory. We show that the LMA configuration is driven by electron motion because its scale size is small with respect to the gyroradius of the solar wind ions. We identify a population of back-streaming ions, the deflection of magnetized electrons via the E × B drift motion, and the subsequent formation of a halo region of elevated density around the dipole source. Finally, it is shown that the presence and efficiency of the processes are heavily impacted by the upstream plasma conditions and, on their turn, influence the overall structure and evolution of the LMA system. Understanding the detailed physics of the solar wind interaction with LMAs, including magnetic shielding, particle dynamics and surface charging is vital to evaluate its implications for lunar exploration.},

Modeling the lunar magnetic anomalies with multiple dipoles in 2.5-D MPD simulations inflates the size of the mini-magnetospheres for only small increases in the magnitude of the total magnetic field. Multiple dipoles increase the lateral distance over which solar wind plasma is held off the surface. This extended magnetic field geometry inflates the mini-magnetosphere by inhibiting fluid flow within the shock region. With multiple dipoles, a mini-magnetosphere will form with magnetic field magnitudes smaller than the lower limit for a single dipole. These results indicate that the higher order moments of the anomalous magnetic fields play a significant role in deflecting the solar wind and determining the size and shape of the mini-magnetosphere.},

The central density cavity expected in the inner mini-magnetosphere (if analogous to other planetary magnetospheres) has proven elusive. We now present Lunar Prospector fly-throughs of a density cavity near a strong crustal magnetic source in the solar wind, and compare these unique observations with typical orbits in the solar wind and wake. We observed the density cavity on two consecutive orbits on July 14, 1999 with optimal viewing geometry, downstream from one of the strongest lunar crustal sources (an anomaly centered at ∼235E, 20S), during very unusual solar wind conditions. We found no other similar features in the solar wind in ∼7 months of low-altitude orbits, suggesting that fully formed lunar mini-magnetospheres are rare and/or difficult to observe from orbit.},

	abstract = {2.5D Particle simulations of the solar wind interaction with the magnetized regions on the surface of the Moon confirm the earlier 2D MHD result that mini-magnetospheres can form around the magnetic anomalies. A dipole buried 100 km below the surface with a field strength equal to 50 nT at the surface and 10 nT at 100 km above the surface held the solar wind off of the surface and caused a bow shock and a magnetopause to form. However, the boundary separating the bow shock and magnetopause becomes ambiguous as the two structures merge due to the small-scale size of the mini-magnetospheres. Acceleration of solar wind particles occurs at the shock. Inside the magnetopause, the Lunar electrons remained highly magnetized and exhibited fluid-like behavior. The Lunar ions, on the other hand, become demagnetized. Outside of the magnetopause, the solar wind ions and electrons exhibited fluid-like behavior. Small-scale and nonideal MHD effects can be included into fluid simulations by adding Hall and pressure gradient terms in Ohm's Law, creating a magnetoplasma dynamics (MPD) model. The small-scale effects allow for field-aligned currents and electric fields that look qualitatively similar to those in the particle simulations, but they do not appear to change the overall shape of the mini-magnetosphere. The extra components of the electric field indicate the presence of charge separation at the shock surface, due to the momentum difference between ions and electrons, and the near the Lunar surface, due to nonideal MHD behavior inside the mini-magnetosphere. The 2.5D MPD model can replicate the ion demagnetization seen in the 2.5D particle simulations.},

Deceleration of the solar wind ions was observed for two major solar wind ion compositions: protons and alpha particles. Deceleration of the solar wind had the same ΔE /q (ΔE: deceleration energy, q: charge) for both protons and alpha particles. In addition, the acceleration energy of the electrons was almost the same as the deceleration energy of the ions. This indicates the existence of an anti-moonward electric field over the magnetic anomaly above the altitude of Kaguya. The reflected ions were observed in a much larger area than the area where magnetic field enhancement was observed. These reflected ions had a higher temperature and lower bulk velocity than the incident solar wind ions. This suggests the existence of a non-adiabatic dissipative interaction between solar wind ions and lunar magnetic anomalies below Kaguya.},

The simulations demonstrate that a basin-forming impact produces a massive, hot, partially ionized cloud of vapor and melt that expands thermally around the Moon, converging near the basin antipode approximately 1 h after the impact for typical impact parameters. In agreement with previous work, analytic calculations of the interaction of this vapor–melt cloud with an initial ambient magnetic field predict a substantial temporary increase in field intensity in the antipodal region. The time of maximum field amplification coincides with a period when impacting ejecta also converge near the antipode. The latter produce antipodal shock stresses within the range of 5–25 GPa where stable shock remanent magnetization (SRM) of lunar soils has been found experimentally to occur. Calculated antipodal ejecta thicknesses are only marginally sufficient to explain the amplitudes of observed magnetic anomalies if mean magnetization intensities are comparable to those produced experimentally. This suggests that pre-existing ejecta materials, which would also contain abundant metallic iron remanence carriers, may be important anomaly sources, a possibility that is consistent with enhanced magnetic anomalies observed peripheral to SPA. The latter anomalies may be produced by amplified secondary ejecta impact shock waves in the thick SPA ejecta mantle occurring near the antipodes of the Imbrium and Serenitatis impacts. Together with converging seismic compressional waves, these antipodal impact shocks may have produced especially deep fracture zones along the northwest edge of SPA near the Imbrium antipode, allowing the ascent of magma with enhanced KREEP concentrations.},

	abstract = {The recent in situ particle measurements near the Moon by Chandrayaan-1 and Kaguya missions as well as the earlier observation by the Lunar Prospector have shown that the Moon-solar wind interaction is more complicated than believed earlier. The new observations have arisen the need for a detailed modelling of the near surface plasma-surface processes and regions near the lunar magnetic anomalies. Especially, interpretation of ion, electron, and energetic neutral atoms (ENA) observations have shown that the plasma cannot be treated as a single fluid but that kinetic effects have to be taken into account. We have studied the kinetic effects and, especially, the role of finite gyro-radius effects at the Moon by kinetic plasma simulations at three different length-scales which exist in the Moon-solar wind interaction. The solar wind interaction with a magnetic dipole, which mimics the lunar magnetic anomalies in this study, is investigated by a 3D self-consistent hybrid model (HYB-Moon) where protons are particles and electrons form a charge neutralizing mass less fluid. This study shows that the particle flux and density and the bulk velocity of the solar wind protons that hit the lunar surface just above the dipole are decreased compared to their undisturbed values. In addition, a particle “halo” region was identified in the simulation, a region around the dipole where the proton density and the particle flux are higher than in the solar wind, qualitatively in agreement with energetic hydrogen atom observations made by the Chandrayaan-1 mission. The near surface plasma within the magnetic anomaly within a Debye sheath is studied by an electromagnetic Particle-in-Cell, PIC, simulation (HYB-es). In the PIC simulation both ions and electrons are treated as particles. Further, we assume in the PIC simulation that the magnetic anomaly blocks away all solar wind particles and the simulation contains only photo-electrons. The analysis shows that the increased magnetic field decreases the strength of the electric potential and results in a thinner potential sheath than without the magnetic field. Overall, the simulations give support for the suggestions that kinetic effects play an important role on the properties of the lunar plasma environment.},

	abstract = {We examined the plasma flow response to meso- and microscale magnetic dipoles by performing three-dimensional full particle-in-cell simulations. We particularly focused on the formation of a magnetosphere and its dependence on the intensity of the magnetic moment. The size of a magnetic dipole immersed in a plasma flow can be characterized by a distance L from the dipole center to the position where the pressure of the local magnetic field becomes equal to the dynamic pressure of the plasma flow under the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation. In this study, we are interested in a magnetic dipole whose L is smaller than the Larmor radius of ions riL calculated with the unperturbed dipole field at the distance L from the center. In the simulation results, we confirmed the clear formation of a magnetosphere consisting of a magnetopause and a tail region in the density profile, although the spatial scale is much smaller than the MHD scale. One of the important findings in this study is that the spatial profiles of the plasma density as well as the current flows are remarkably affected by the finite Larmor radius effect of the plasma flow, which is different from the Earth's magnetosphere. The magnetopause found in the upstream region is located at a position much closer to the dipole center than L. In the equatorial plane, we also found an asymmetric density profile with respect to the plasma flow direction, which is caused by plasma gyration in the dipole field region. The ion current layers are created in the inner region of the dipole field, and the electron current also flows in the region beyond the ion current layer because ions with a large inertia can closely approach the dipole center. Unlike the ring current structure of the Earth's magnetosphere, the current layers in the microscale dipole fields are not circularly closed around the dipole center. Since the major current is caused by the particle gyrations, the current is independently determined to be in the direction of the electron and ion gyrations, which are the same in both the upstream and downstream regions. The present analysis on the formation of a magnetosphere in the regime of a microscale magnetic dipole is significant for understanding the solar wind response to the crustal magnetic anomalies on the Moon surface, such as were recently observed by spacecraft.},

We explicitly include the plasma physics necessary to account for the solar wind and its induced effects. We show that, by capturing/containing this plasma, we enhance the effectiveness of the shield. Further evidence to support our conclusions can be obtained from studying naturally occurring “mini-magnetospheres” on the Moon. These magnetic anomalies (related to “lunar swirls”) exhibit many of the effects seen in laboratory experiments and computer simulations. If shown to be feasible, this technology could become the gateway to manned exploration of interplanetary space.},

	abstract = {Kinetic plasma simulation typically requires to handle a multiplicity of space and time scales. The implicit moment particle in cell (PIC) method provides a possible route to address the presence of multiple scales effectively. Here, a new implementation of the implicit moment method is described. The present paper has two goals. First, the most modern implementation of the implicit moment method is described. While many of the algorithms involved have been developed in the past, the present paper reports for the first time how the implicit moment method is currently implemented and what specific algorithms have been found to work best. Second, we present the CELESTE3D code, a fully electromagnetic and fully kinetic PIC code, based on the implicit moment method. The code has been in use for a number of years but no previous complete description of its implementation has been provided. The present work fills this gap and introduces a number of new methods not previously presented: a new implementation of the Maxwell solver and a new particle mover based on a Newton-Krylov nonlinear solver for the discretized Newton’s equations. A number of benchmarks of CELESTE3D are presented to shown the typical application and to investigate the improvements introduced by the new solver and the new mover.},

	abstract = {Graph Neural Network (GNN) research is rapidly growing thanks to the capacity of GNNs in learning distributed representations from graph-structured data. However, centralizing a massive amount of real-world graph data for GNN training is prohibitive due to privacy concerns, regulation restrictions, and commercial competitions. Federated learning (FL), a trending distributed learning paradigm, provides possibilities to solve this challenge while preserving data privacy. Despite recent advances in vision and language domains, there is no suitable platform for the FL of GNNs. To this end, we introduce FedGraphNN, an open FL benchmark system that can facilitate research on federated GNNs. FedGraphNN is built on a unified formulation of graph FL and contains a wide range of datasets from different domains, popular GNN models, and FL algorithms, with secure and efficient system support. Particularly for the datasets, we collect, preprocess, and partition 36 datasets from 7 domains, including both publicly available ones and specifically obtained ones such as hERG and Tencent. Our empirical analysis showcases the utility of our benchmark system, while exposing significant challenges in graph FL: federated GNNs perform worse in most datasets with a non-IID split than centralized GNNs; the GNN model that attains the best result in the centralized setting may not maintain its advantage in the FL setting. These results imply that more research efforts are needed to unravel the mystery behind federated GNNs. Moreover, our system performance analysis demonstrates that the FedGraphNN system is computationally efficient and secure to large-scale graphs datasets. We maintain the source code at https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedGraphNN.},

This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents the principle of relativity. According to this principle, all the laws of nature are identical in all inertial systems of reference. In other words, the equations expressing the laws of nature are invariant with respect to transformations of coordinates and time from one inertial system to another. This means that the equation describing any law of nature, when written in terms of coordinates and time in different inertial reference systems, has one and the same form. The combination of the principle of relativity with the finiteness of the velocity of propagation of interactions is called the principle of relativity of Einstein, formulated by Einstein in 1905, in contrast to the principle of relativity of Galileo, which was based on an infinite velocity of propagation of interactions. The idea of an absolute time is in complete contradiction to the Einstein principle of relativity. For this, it is sufficient to recall that in classical mechanics, based on the concept of an absolute time, a general law of combination of velocities is valid, according to which the velocity of a composite motion is simply equal to the (vector) sum of the velocities which constitute this motion. This law, being universal, should also be applicable to the propagation of interactions. The principle of relativity leads to the result that time is not absolute. Time elapses differently in different systems of reference.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the relativistic mechanics of Einstein theory of relativity. The principle of least action asserts that the integral S must be a minimum only for infinitesimal lengths of the path of integration. For paths of arbitrary length, it can be said that S must be an extremum and not necessarily a minimum. For a closed system, in addition to conservation of energy and momentum, there is conservation of angular momentum, that is, of the vector M = ∑ r × p, where r and p are the radius vector and momentum of the particle; the summation runs over all the particles making up the system. The conservation of angular momentum is a consequence of the fact that because of the isotropy of space, the Lagrangian of a closed system does not change under a rotation of the system as a whole. In relativistic mechanics, the definition of the center of inertia of a system of interacting particles requires the explicit inclusion of the momentum and energy of the field produced by the particles. Although in the system K0 (in which Σ p = 0), the angular momentum is independent of the choice of the point with respect to which it is defined, in the K system (in which Σ p ≠ 0) the angular momentum does depend on this choice.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores charge particles in electromagnetic fields. In the theory of relativity, elementary particles are considered as rigid bodies whose dimensions all remain unchanged in the reference system in which they are at rest. However, it is easy to see that the theory of relativity makes the existence of rigid bodies impossible in general. A charge located in a field not only is subjected to a force exerted by the field, but also in turn acts on the field, changing it. However, if the charge e is not large, the action of the charge on the field can be neglected. The equations of motion of a charge in an electromagnetic field are invariant with respect to a change in sign of the time, that is, the two time directions are equivalent. Thus, if a certain motion is possible according to the equations of mechanics, the reverse motion is also possible, in which the system passes through the same states in reverse order. Furthermore, the gauge invariance of the equations of electrodynamics and the conservation of charge are closely related to one another. The constancy of the acceleration of a charged particle is related to the fact that the electric field does not change for Lorentz transformations having velocities V along the direction of the field.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the electromagnetic field equations. From the first pair of Maxwell's equations, it was found that the two equations still do not completely determine the properties of the fields. This is clear from the fact that they determine the change of the magnetic field with time (the derivative ∂H/∂t) but do not determine the derivative ∂E/∂t. According to Gauss's theorem of electromagnetic fields, the net outward normal electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed within that closed surface. On the other hand, Stokes' theorem states that the line integral of an electric field (E) bounding over a closed surface is equal to curl integral of E over the surface. The integral of a vector over a closed contour is called the circulation of the vector around the contour. The circulation of the electric field is also called the electromotive force in the given contour. Thus, the electromotive force in any contour is equal to minus the time derivative of the magnetic flux through a surface bounded by this contour. The Maxwell equations can be expressed in four-dimensional notation. In addition to the Gaussian system, one also uses the Heaviside system, in which a = −¼. In this system of units the field equations have a more convenient form (4π does not appear) but on the other hand, π appears in the Coulomb law. Conversely, in the Gaussian system, the field equations contain 4π, but the Coulomb law has a simple form.},

If there is a system of charges, then the held produced by this system is equal, according to the principle of superposition, to the sum of the fields produced by each of the particles individually. In determining the energy of a system of charges, it is started from the energy of the field, that is, from the expression for the energy density. From the Larmor's theorem, the derivative of average angular momentum (M) of the system is equal to the moment (K) of the forces acting on the system. If the e/m ratio is the same for all particles of the system, the angular momentum and magnetic moment are proportional to one another.

	abstract = {This chapter presents electromagnetic waves and monochromatic plan waves. Plan waves are the electromagnetic waves, in which the electromagnetic field depends only on one coordinate, such as, x (and on the time). In each plane x = constant, the field changes with the time; at each given moment, the field is different for different x. If, at some time t= 0, the field at a certain point x in space had some definite value, then after an interval of time t, the field has that same value at a distance ct along the X axis from the original place. Thus, all the values of the electromagnetic field are propagated in space along the X axis with a velocity equal to the velocity of light, c. The vector potential of the plane wave can always be chosen perpendicular to the X axis, that is, to the direction of propagation of that wave. The energy flux in the plane wave, that is, its Pointing vector is directed along the direction of propagation of the wave. However, the energy density of the wave propagates with the velocity of light. By using the law of transformation of the wave four-vector, the so-called Doppler effect—the change in frequency Ω of the wave emitted by a source moving with respect to the observer, as compared to the "true" frequency Ω0 of the same source in the reference system (K0) in which it is at rest—can be easily treated.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews the wave propagation of light. A plane wave is characterized by the property that its direction of propagation and amplitude are the same everywhere. The wave surfaces of a plane wave are obviously planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. The study of the laws of propagation of waves constitutes the domain of geometrical optics, which considers the propagation of waves, and in particular of light, as the propagation of rays, completely divorced from their wave properties. In other words, geometrical optics corresponds to the limiting case of small wavelength, λ → 0. In geometrical optics, the light wave can be considered as a bundle of rays. The rays themselves, however, determine only the direction of propagation of the light at each point; there remains the question of the distribution of the light intensity in space. In studying the passage of beams of rays through optical systems, special interest attaches to bundles whose rays all pass through one point. The point of intersection can lie either on the rays themselves or on their continuations; depending on this, the image is said to be real or virtual. It can be shown that the problem of image formation with the aid of narrow bundles, moving in the neighborhood of the optical axis in a nonaxially-symmetric system, can be reduced to image formation in an axially-symmetric system plus a subsequent rotation of the image thus obtained, relative to the object.},

The electric field of the Lienard–Wiechert potentials consists of two parts of different type. The first term depends only on the velocity of the particle (and not on its acceleration) and varies at large distances like 1/R2. The second term depends on the acceleration, and for large R it varies like 1/R. As for the first term, because it is independent of the acceleration, it must correspond to the field produced by a uniformly moving charge. For systems consisting of particles with the same charge-to-mass ratio, the appearance of radiation is put off to the fifth approximation in v/c; in such a case, there is a Lagrangian to terms of fourth order in v/c.},

At sufficiently large distances from the system of charges, the field over small regions of space can be considered to be a plane wave. For this, it is necessary that the distance be large compared not only with the dimensions of the system but also with the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves radiated by the system. This region of space is referred to as the wave zone of the radiation. In a plane wave, the fields E and H are related to each other by E = H x n. Since H = curl A, it is sufficient for a complete determination of the field in the wave zone to calculate only the vector potential. The field at large distances is inversely proportional to the first power of the distance R0 from the radiating system. The radiated electromagnetic waves carry off energy. The energy flux is given by the Pointing vector for a plane wave. The intensity dI of radiation into the element of solid angle d0 is defined as the amount of energy passing in unit time through the element df= R02d0 of the spherical surface with center at the origin and radius R0. This quantity is clearly equal to the energy flux density S multiplied by df. From the study of radiation of a rapidly moving charge, it was found that an ultrarelativistic particle radiates mainly along the direction of its own motion, within the small range of angles around the direction of its velocity.},

The fields to which noninertial reference systems are equivalent are not completely identical with actual gravitational fields that occur also in inertial frames for there is a very essential difference with respect to their behavior at infinity. The centrifugal force that appears in a rotating reference system increases without limit as one moves away from the axis of rotation; the field to which a reference system in accelerated linear motion is equivalent is the same over all space and also at infinity. The fields to which noninertial systems are equivalent vanish as soon as we transform to an inertial system.

In a curved space, the parallel displacement of a vector from one given point to another gives different results if the displacement is carried out over different paths. The Einstein equations are nonlinear and are the required equations of the gravitational field—the basic equation of the general theory of relativity. Therefore, for gravitational fields, the principle of superposition is not valid. The principle is valid only approximately for weak fields that permit a linearization of the Einstein equations, particularly the gravitational field in the classical Newtonian limit. The equation of state relates to one another not two but three thermodynamic quantities, for example, the pressure, density, and temperature of the matter. In applications in the theory of gravitation, this point is, however, not important, as the approximate equations of state used here actually do not depend on the temperature. To understand the solution of the Einstein equations for given initial conditions (in the time), the question of the number of quantities for which the initial spatial distribution can be assigned arbitrarily must be considered. The Einstein equations can also be written in an analogous way for the general case of a time-dependent metric.},

The scalar curvature properties of an isotropic space are determined by just one constant. Corresponding to this, there are altogether three different possible cases for the spatial metric: (1) the so-called space of constant positive curvature (corresponding to a positive value of λ ), (2) space of constant negative curvature (corresponding to values of λ {\textless}0), and (3) space with zero curvature (λ = 0). Of these, the last will be a flat, which is Euclidean, space. The solution corresponding to an isotropic space of negative curvature—open isotropic model—is obtained by a method completely analogous to the preceding. The isotropic solutions found exist only when the matter density is different from zero; for empty space, the Einstein equations have no such solutions. The conclusion that the bodies are running away with increasing a (t) can only be made if the energy of interaction of the matter is small compared to the kinetic energy of its motion in the recession; this condition is always satisfied for sufficiently distant galaxies. In the opposite case, the mutual separations of the bodies are determined mainly by their interactions.},

	abstract = {As the solar wind is incident upon the lunar surface, it will occasionally encounter lunar crustal remanent magnetic fields. These magnetic fields are small-scale, highly non-dipolar, have strengths up to hundreds of nanotesla, and typically interact with the solar wind in a kinetic fashion. Simulations, theoretical analyses, and spacecraft observations have shown that crustal fields can reflect solar wind protons via a combination of magnetic and electrostatic reflection; however, analyses of surface properties have suggested that protons may still access the lunar surface in the cusp regions of crustal magnetic fields. In this first report from a planned series of studies, we use a 11/2-dimensional, electrostatic particle-in-cell code to model the self-consistent interaction between the solar wind, the cusp regions of lunar crustal remanent magnetic fields, and the lunar surface. We describe the self-consistent electrostatic environment within crustal cusp regions and discuss the implications of this work for the role that crustal fields may play regulating space weathering of the lunar surface via proton bombardment.},

	abstract = {The Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer has obtained the first global map of lunar crustal magnetic fields, revealing that the effects of basin-forming impacts dominate the large-scale distribution of remanent magnetic fields on the Moon. The weakest surface magnetic fields ({\textless}0.2 nT) are found within two of the largest and most recent impact basins, Orientale and Imbrium. Conversely, the largest concentrations of strong surface fields ({\textgreater}40 nT) are diametrically opposite to these same basins. This pattern is present though less pronounced for several other post-Nectarian impact basins larger than 500 km in diameter. The reduced strength and clarity of the pattern for older basins may be attributed to: (1) demagnetization from many smaller impacts, which erases antipodal magnetic signatures over time, (2) superposition effects from other large impacts, and (3) variation in the strength of the ambient magnetizing field. The absence of fringing fields stronger than 1 nT around the perimeter of the Imbrium basin or associated with craters within the basin implies that any uniform magnetization of the impact melt must be weaker than ∼10−6 G cm3 g−1. This limits the strength of any steady ambient magnetic field to no more than ∼0.1 Oe at the lunar surface while the basin cooled for tens of millions of years following the Imbrium impact 3.8 billion years ago.},

RGA is one of the strongest magnetic anomalies on the Moon. Two magnetic anomalies are found from six MAG datasets at 17–40 km altitudes in the lunar wake or the geomagnetic tail lobe and are well explained by a two-dipole model. When RGA was exposed to the solar wind plasma, two MAG datasets were obtained at 27–29 km altitudes. Although the magnetic anomalies survived against the plasma pressure, they were heavily distorted in comparison with the magnetic field of the two-dipole model. Flow directions and dynamic pressures of the solar wind plasma at those periods indicate that the distortions were caused by forming a mini-magnetosphere over the RGA region in the solar wind.},

	abstract = {Many of the Moon's crustal magnetic anomalies are accompanied by high albedo features known as swirls. A leading hypothesis suggests that swirls are formed where crustal magnetic anomalies, acting as mini magnetospheres, shield portions of the surface from the darkening effects of solar wind ion bombardment, thereby leaving patches that appear bright compared with their surroundings. If this hypothesis is correct, then magnetic field direction should influence swirl morphology. Using Lunar Prospector magnetometer data and Clementine reflectance mosaics, we find evidence that bright regions correspond with dominantly horizontal magnetic fields at Reiner Gamma and that vertical magnetic fields are associated with the intraswirl dark lane at Airy. We use a genetic search algorithm to model the distributions of magnetic source material at both anomalies, and we show that source models constrained by the observed albedo pattern (i.e., strongly horizontal surface fields in bright areas, vertical surface fields in dark lanes) produce fields that are consistent with the Lunar Prospector magnetometer measurements. These findings support the solar wind deflection hypothesis and may help to explain not only the general form of swirls, but also the finer aspects of their morphology. Our source models may also be used to make quantitative predictions of the near surface magnetic field, which must ultimately be tested with very low altitude spacecraft measurements. If our predictions are correct, our models could have implications for the structure of the underlying magnetic material and the nature of the magnetizing field.},

	abstract = {We survey Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer measurements from times when the Moon was located in the geomagnetic tail, in order to characterize the occurrence of large ({\textgreater}500 V) negative lunar surface potentials, as identified by upward-going electron beams. We find that charging to these levels is rare, but that such charging events do occasionally occur in both sunlight and shadow. Large surface potentials are found primarily in the plasma sheet, and their occurrence depends mainly on the incident electron spectrum rather than surface properties. Most examples occur in shadow, where the current from energetic electrons dominates. However, some occur in sunlight, suggesting the occasional presence of either lower photoemission than expected or non-monotonic potentials. Depending on the electric field scale height, significant electric fields of up to ∼100 V/m may sometimes exist at the lunar surface.},

	abstract = {The dayside near-surface lunar plasma environment is electrostatically complex, due to the interaction between solar UV-induced photoemission, the collection of ambient ions and electrons, and the presence of micron and sub-micron sized dust grains. Further complicating this environment, although less well understood in effect, is the presence of surface relief, typically in the form of craters and/or boulders. It has been suggested that such non-trivial surface topography can lead to complex electrostatic potentials and fields, including “mini-wakes” behind small obstacles to the solar wind flow and “supercharging” near sunlit-shadowed boundaries (Criswell, D.R., De, B.R. [1977]. J. Geophys. Res. 82 (7); De, B.R., Criswell, D.R. [1977]. J. Geophys. Res. 82 (7); Farrell, W.M., Stubbs, T.J., Vondrak, R.R., Delory, G.T., Halekas, J.S. [2007]. Geophys. Res.

In this paper, we present results from a three-dimensional, self-consistent, electrostatic particle-in-cell code used to model the dayside near-surface lunar plasma environment over a variety of local times with the presence of a crater. Additionally, we use the particle-in-cell model output to study the effect of surface topography on the dynamics of electrostatic dust transport, with the goal of understanding previous observations of dust dynamics on the Moon and dust ponding on various asteroids.},

Gyrosynchrotron emission in flares reveal the presence of relativistic electrons, which, in active stars, seem to persist even during quasi-quiet (quiescent) intervals. Coherent emissions of solar electron beams by the two-stream instability has been discovered up to 8 GHz. Particularly efficient emitters are trapped electrons having a loss-cone distribution. This is probably the most frequent cause of highly polarized stellar radio flares. Of greatest interest are emissions by unstable currents and shocks, which have been identified in the solar corona. A general introduction into some basic theories, but not a review, is given, illustrated with recent observations. A more extended introduction can be found in Benz (1993).},

In strongly collisional plasmas reconnection proceeds via resistive current sheets, the theory of which is presented in some detail. At weak collisionality the reconnection dynamics is domainated by nondissipative effects, which in low-β plasmas are mainly the Hall term and electron inertia. The equations of electron magnetohydrodynamics are introduced, which allow a rather complete analysis of the reconnection configuration, yielding reconnection rates independent of the smallness parameters of the system. Including the coupling to the ions the reconnection rate is found to depend only on ion inertia. Hence collisionless reconnection can be very rapid proceeding essentially on the Alfvén time scale.},

	abstract = {This book provides a systematic introduction to the observation and application of kinetic Alfven waves (KAWs) in various plasma environments, with a special focus on the solar-terrestrial coupling system. Alfven waves are low-frequency and long-wavelength fluctuations that pervade laboratory, space and cosmic plasmas. KAWs are dispersive Alfven waves with a short wavelength comparable to particle kinematic scales and hence can play important roles in the energization and transport of plasma particles, the formation of fine magneto-plasma structures, and the dissipation of turbulent Alfven waves.

Since the 1990s, experimental studies on KAWs in laboratory and space plasmas have significantly advanced our understanding of KAWs, making them an increasingly interesting subject. Without a doubt, the solar–terrestrial coupling system provides us with a unique natural laboratory for the comprehensive study of KAWs. This book presents extensive observations of KAWs in solar and heliospheric plasmas, as well as numerous applications of KAWs in the solar-terrestrial coupling system, including solar atmosphere heating, solarwind turbulence, solar wind-magnetosphere interactions, and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.

In addition, for the sake of consistency, the book includes the basic theories and physical properties of KAWs, as well as their experimental demonstrations in laboratory plasmas. In closing, it discusses possible applications of KAWs to other astrophysical plasmas. Accordingly, the book covers all the major aspects of KAWs in a coherent manner that will appeal to advanced graduate students and researchers whose work involves laboratory, space and astrophysical plasmas.},

The formula is used to rederive standard formulae for emission by classical particles in vacuo and to treat the astrophysical plasma processes of gyromagnetic, synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The semiclassical or semiquantum theory is introduced by the treatment of the waves as a collection of wave quanta, and the Einstein coefficients are used to relate absorption to emission.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07078},
	abstract = {Deep neural networks have shown the ability to extract universal feature representations from data such as images and text that have been useful for a variety of learning tasks. However, the fruits of representation learning have yet to be fully-realized in federated settings. Although data in federated settings is often non-i.i.d. across clients, the success of centralized deep learning suggests that data often shares a global feature representation, while the statistical heterogeneity across clients or tasks is concentrated in the labels. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client. Our algorithm harnesses the distributed computational power across clients to perform many local-updates with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation. We prove that this method obtains linear convergence to the ground-truth representation with near-optimal sample complexity in a linear setting, demonstrating that it can efficiently reduce the problem dimension for each client. This result is of interest beyond federated learning to a broad class of problems in which we aim to learn a shared low-dimensional representation among data distributions, for example in meta-learning and multi-task learning.

Using a similar structure as the previous book the second volume provides a seamless continuation of numerous novel research results in solar physics that emerged in the new millennium (after 2000) from the new solar missions of RHESSI, STEREO, Hinode, CORONAS, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during the era of 2000-2018. The new solar space missions are characterized by unprecedented high-resolution imaging, time resolution, spectral capabilities, stereoscopy and tomography, which reveal the intricate dynamics of magneto-hydrodynamic processes in the solar corona down to scales of 100 km. The enormous amount of data streaming down from SDO in Terabytes per day requires advanced automated data processing methods. The book focuses exclusively on new research results after 2000, which are reviewed in a comprehensive manner, documented by over 3600 literature references, covering theory, observations, and numerical modeling of basic physical processes that are observed in high-temperature plasmas of the Sun and other astrophysical objects, such as plasma instabilities, coronal heating, magnetic reconnection processes, coronal mass ejections, plasma waves and oscillations, or particle acceleration.},

The kinetic model presented attempts to combine the macroscopic and microscopic tasks. It relies only on the Maxwell curl equations and the Lorentz equation for particles, which are ideally suited for computers. The preliminary results shown are for an unmagnetized solar-wind plasma streaming past a dipolar magnetic field. The results show the formation of a bow shock and a magnetotail, the penetration of energetic particles into cusp and radiation belt regions, and dawn-dusk asymmetries.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In the nearly seven years since I finished writing the first edition of this book research on the accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms has continued to flourish and mature. Our understanding of algorithms has steadily improved, and in some areas new or improved algorithms have been derived. Three developments during this period deserve particular note. First, the widespread adoption of electronic publication of journals and the increased practice of posting technical reports and preprints on the Web have both made research results more quickly available than before. Second, the inclusion of routines from state-of-the-art numerical software libraries such as LAPACK in packages such as MATLAB and Maple has brought the highest-quality algorithms to a very wide audience. Third, IEEE arithmetic is now ubiquitous—indeed, it is hard to find a computer whose arithmetic does not comply with the standard. This new edition is a major revision of the book that brings it fully up to date, expands the coverage, and includes numerous improvements to the original material. The changes reflect my own experiences in using the book, as well as suggestions received from readers. The changes to the book can be summarized as follows.},

The results suggest that not only can a bow shock and magnetopause form around the small anomalies, but their position and shape can change dramatically with changes in the solar wind conditions. A switch from southward to northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) causes the size of the mini-magnetosphere to increase by 90\% and the magnetic field at various positions inside the bow shock to increase by a factor of 10. In addition to affecting the stand-off distance, changes in the IMF can also cause the mini-magnetosphere to go from very round to flat and elongated. The scale size of the mini-magnetospheres is 100 km for the range of typical solar wind conditions and the surface magnetic field strengths measured by Lunar Prospector. A stagnation point inside the shock region also exists for several solar wind conditions.},

	abstract = {Plasma signature around crustal magnetic fields is one of the most important topics of the lunar plasma sciences. Although recent spacecraft measurements are revealing solar–wind interaction with the lunar crustal fields on the dayside, plasma signatures around crustal fields on the night side have not been fully studied yet. Here we show evidence of plasma trapping on the closed field lines of the lunar crustal fields in the solar–wind wake, using SELENE (Kaguya) plasma and magnetic field data obtained at 14–15km altitude from the lunar surface. In contrast to expectation on plasma cavity formation at the strong crustal fields, electron flux is enhanced above Crisium Antipode (CA) anomaly which is one of the strongest lunar crustal fields. The enhanced electron fluxes above CA are characterised by (1) occasional bi-directional field-aligned beams in the lower energy range ({\textless}150eV) and (2) a medium energy component (150–300eV) that has a double loss-cone distribution representing bounce motion between the two footprints of the crustal magnetic fields. The low-energy electrons on the closed field lines may come from the lunar night side surface, while supply mechanism of medium-energy electrons on the closed field line remains to be solved. We also report that a density cavity in the wake is observed not above the strongest magnetic field but in its vicinity.},

In experiment a specific magnetic field was observed which is non-coplanar to dipole field, does not change sign at dipole moment inversion and could be generated only via the quadratic Hall term. Magnetopause position and plasma stand off distance were found to be profoundly different between the experimental regimes with small and large ion inertia length. In the previous studies of a mini-magnetosphere by kinetic codes such novel features were observed as absence of the bow shock and plasma stopping at the Stoermer particle limit instead of the pressure balance distance. Proposed analytical model explains these features by Hall currents which tend to cancel magnetic field convection by ions. Performed numerical simulation shows a good agreement with experiment and analytical model. It gives detailed spatial structure of the Hall field and reveals that while ions penetrate deep inside mini-magnetosphere electrons overflow around it along magnetopause boundary.},

We present the first three-dimensional full-kinetic electromagnetic simulation case study of the solar wind interaction with a vertical dipole, resembling a medium-size LMA. In contrast to a horizontal dipole, we show that a vertical dipole twists its field lines and cannot form a minimagnetosphere. Instead, it creates a ring-shaped weathering pattern and reflects up to 21\% (four times more as compared to the horizontal case) of the incoming solar wind ions electrostatically through the normal electric field formed above the electron shielding region surrounding the cusp. This work delivers a vital piece to fully comprehend and interpret lunar observations, as we find the amount of reflected ions to be a tracer for the underlying field structure.},

The input magnetic field model is based on orbital-altitude observations from the Kaguya and Lunar Prospector missions. We develop eight simulation cases, representing the distinct plasma regimes. Reiner Gamma is exposed to along a typical orbit, including different solar wind incidence angles and the magnetosheath crossing. We show that the plasma environment is vastly different at different altitudes and depends critically on the upstream plasma parameters, consistent with the predictions of the solar wind standoff model.

	abstract = {The Moon once possessed a dynamo that produced numerous magnetic anomalies in the lunar lithosphere. Determining the ages and magnetization strengths of these anomalies would constrain the timing and strength of the dynamo. Unfortunately, most anomalies are not associated with dated geologic features. Here we report that the northeastern portion of the Reiner Gamma magnetic anomaly overlies a relative-negative Bouguer gravity anomaly that we interpret to be a buried impact crater (consistent with Evans et al., 2016). Reiner Gamma is associated with sinuous optical markings known as swirls, which are likely correlated with the underlying magnetization. These markings provide a higher resolution map of the magnetization than possible with existing field data. We present two arguments that suggest the crater overprinted by the Reiner Gamma swirl formed in a pre-existing flood basalt layer. Hence, we constrain the Reiner Gamma source body's age to be bounded by the approximate duration of mare volcanism, {\textasciitilde}3.3 Ga to {\textasciitilde}3.9 Ga. This range includes the putative high-field epoch of the Moon's dynamo ({\textasciitilde}3.56–3.9 Ga), which could explain Reiner Gamma's high magnetization. Finally, we calculate the potential range of positions of the rim of the buried crater, and find that the main body of Reiner Gamma is likely outside the buried rim. This finding may be useful for constraining the origin of the Reiner Gamma magnetic source bodies.},

	abstract = {We investigate the possibility that a strong core dynamo of the Moon has magnetized the lunar crust. The magnetic data from two missions, Lunar Prospector and Kaguya, are used and the magnetic fields of two different features are examined: The isolated small magnetic source bodies with almost no topographic signatures, and the impact craters with diameters larger than 100km. Five data sets are examined separately for each of the isolated magnetic anomalies: the r, θ, and φ components of the Lunar Prospector data, the r component of a 150-degree spherical harmonic model of the lunar magnetic field, and the r component of the Kaguya data. The r component of the Lunar Prospector data is also used to derive the magnetic field over the impact craters. We conclude that most of the ancient lunar far side crust is heterogeneously magnetized with coherency wavelength about a few hundred km. The paleomagnetic north poles determined from modeling the magnetic field of both features show some clustering whereas the source bodies are widely distributed, suggesting that the magnetizing field may have been a core dynamo field. Paleointensity data suggest that the core field intensity was at least 1mT at the core mantle boundary. There is also evidence for core field reversals, because further clustering occurs when the south poles of some features are considered.},

Not all LMAs can be associated with albedo markings, making swirls, and their possible connection with the former, an intriguing puzzle yet to be solved. By coupling fully kinetic simulations with a Surface Vector Mapping model, we show that solar wind standoff, an ion–electron kinetic interaction mechanism that locally prevents weathering by solar wind ions, reproduces the shape of the Reiner Gamma albedo pattern. Our method reveals why not every magnetic anomaly forms a distinct albedo marking. A qualitative match between optical remote observations and in situ particle measurements of the back-scattered ions is simultaneously achieved, demonstrating the importance of a kinetic approach to describe the solar wind interaction with LMAs. The anti-correlation between the predicted amount of surface weathering and the surface reflectance is strongest when evaluating the proton energy flux.},

	abstract = {ARTEMIS observes pickup ions around the Moon, at distances of up to 20,000 km from the surface. The observed ions form a plume with a narrow spatial and angular extent, generally seen in a single energy/angle bin of the ESA instrument. Though ARTEMIS has no mass resolution capability, we can utilize the analytically describable characteristics of pickup ion trajectories to constrain the possible ion masses that can reach the spacecraft at the observation location in the correct energy/angle bin. We find that most of the observations are consistent with a mass range of ∼20–45 amu, with a smaller fraction consistent with higher masses, and very few consistent with masses below ∼15 amu. With the assumption that the highest fluxes of pickup ions come from near the surface, the observations favor mass ranges of ∼20–24 and ∼36–40 amu. Although many of the observations have properties consistent with a surface or near-surface release of ions, some do not, suggesting that at least some of the observed ions have an exospheric source. Of all the proposed sources for ions and neutrals about the Moon, the pickup ion flux measured by ARTEMIS correlates best with the solar wind proton flux, indicating that sputtering plays a key role in either directly producing ions from the surface, or producing neutrals that subsequently become ionized.},

These compressional disturbances occur at or just in front of the terminator, but only when specific selenographic regions appear at the lunar limb. The occurrence rate, strength, and position of the compression relative to the limb are different for each source region. Where overlap of limb compression occurrence statistics and lunar magnetic field maps exist, the limb compression occurrence rates have a high degree of correlation with the magnetic field strength. Thus the most probable cause of limb compressions is the deflection of the solar wind by the lunar surface magnetic field as the solar wind flows past the lunar terminators.},

	abstract = {Electron distributions measured by Lunar Prospector above the dayside lunar surface in the solar wind often have an energy dependent loss cone, inconsistent with adiabatic magnetic reflection. Energy dependent reflection suggests the presence of downward parallel electric fields below the spacecraft, possibly indicating the presence of a standing electrostatic structure. Many electron distributions contain apparent low energy ({\textless}100 eV) upward-going conics (58\% of the time) and beams (12\% of the time), primarily in regions with non-zero crustal magnetic fields, implying the presence of parallel electric fields and/or wave-particle interactions below the spacecraft. Some, but not all, of the observed energy dependence comes from the energy gained during reflection from a moving obstacle; correctly characterizing electron reflection requires the use of the proper reference frame. Non-adiabatic reflection may also play a role, but cannot fully explain observations. In cases with upward-going beams, we observe partial isotropization of incoming solar wind electrons, possibly indicating streaming and/or whistler instabilities. The Moon may therefore influence solar wind plasma well upstream from its surface. Magnetic anomaly interactions and/or non-monotonic near surface potentials provide the most likely candidates to produce the observed precursor effects, which may help ensure quasi-neutrality upstream from the Moon.},

It then briefly outlines the observed properties of a variety of classes of lunar upstream waves, as well as their generation mechanisms currently proposed, in association with the lunar upstream particle distributions. The lunar upstream region magnetically connected to the Moon and its wake, the fore-moon, represents a remarkably rich zoo of different classes of waves and different types of particles. Although recent observations have substantially enhanced our knowledge by revealing a number of new categories of upstream particles and waves at the Moon, many fundamental questions remain unanswered, and these are outlined in the chapter.},

	abstract = {AbstractWe present Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) observations of electron-wave interactions which extend to quite large distances upstream from the Moon. We first study electron velocity distributions and wave spectra on an event basis. In both the solar wind and terrestrial plasma sheet, we observe strong whistler wave activity on the magnetic field lines connected to the dayside lunar surface. These whistlers are most likely driven by the anisotropy of upward electrons caused by surface absorption. The whistler growth rates computed from the measured electron distributions successfully reproduced the spectral characteristics of the observed ∼100 Hz narrowband oscillations and those reaching lower frequencies. Meanwhile, the incoming solar wind strahl beam is occasionally isotropized near the Moon, and broadband electrostatic waves are observed simultaneously, suggesting streaming instabilities between the incoming and outgoing beams. Based on the case study, we statistically survey the spatial variations of the characteristic quantities of the upstream electron-wave interactions. Both the electron anisotropy and electromagnetic wave intensity decay with increasing field line distances but remain higher than the ambient level at 6 lunar radii (∼10,000 km) or more. The strahl electron isotropization and electrostatic waves are found mainly at lower altitudes below 1 lunar radius. The electron anisotropy and whistler intensity exhibit clear anticorrelation with crustal magnetic fields, indicating that the magnetic anomalies suppress the whistler wave growth. The ARTEMIS observations convincingly illustrate that the lunar influence on electrons reaches out to 6 lunar radii or more upstream from the Moon.},

The more advanced sections cover the material first taught in the Advanced Topics in Plasma Physics course during the extraordinary Trinity Term of 2020, under the coronavirus lockdown. Part II is an introduction to magnetohydrodynamics, which was part of the course on Advanced Fluid Dynamics, taught (since 2015) jointly with Paul Dellar. These notes evolved from two earlier courses: “Advanced Plasma Theory,” taught as a graduate course at Imperial College in 2008, and “Magnetohydrodynamics and Turbulence,” taught three times as a Mathematics Part III course at Cambridge in 2005-06. Extracts from these notes have also been used in (and in part written for) my lectures at successive plasma-physics sessions of  ́ Ecole de Physique des Houches in 2017 and 2019. Finally, Part III of these notes is dedicated to the marriage of kinetics and MHD and originates from the Les Houches lectures of 2013 and 2015.

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

New observations and modeling results are put into the context of the prior model framework. Significant issues and concerns about the shortcomings of the NENL model are addressed. Such issues as ionosphere-tail coupling, large-scale mapping, onset triggering, and observational timing are discussed. It is concluded that the NENL model is evolving and being improved so as to include new observations and theoretical insights. More work is clearly required in order to incorporate fully the complete set of ionospheric, near-tail, midtail, and deep tail features of substorms. Nonetheless, the NENL model still seems to provide the best available framework for ordering the complex, global manifestations of substorms.},

	abstract = {The transmission of a sheath region driven by an interplanetary coronal mass ejection into the Earth's magnetosheath is studied by investigating in situ magnetic field measurements upstream and downstream of the bow shock during an ICME sheath passage on 15 May 2005. We observe three distinct intervals in the immediate upstream region that included a southward magnetic field component and are traveling foreshocks. These traveling foreshocks were observed in the quasi-parallel bow shock that hosted backstreaming ions and magnetic fluctuations at ultralow frequencies. The intervals constituting traveling foreshocks in the upstream survive transmission to the Earth's magnetosheath, where their magnetic field, and particularly the southward component, was significantly amplified. Our results further suggest that the magnetic field fluctuations embedded in an ICME sheath may survive the transmission if their frequency is below ∼0.01 Hz. Although one of the identified intervals was coherent, extending across the ICME sheath and being long-lived, predicting ICME sheath magnetic fields that may transmit to the Earth's magnetosheath from the upstream at L1 observations has ambiguity. This can result from the strong spatial variability of the ICME sheath fields in the longitudinal direction, or alternatively from the ICME sheath fields developing substantially within the short time it takes the plasma to propagate from L1 to the bow shock. This study demonstrates the complex interplay ICME sheaths have with the Earth's magnetosphere when passing by the planet.},

Our goal is to develop and provide an open end-to-end (Sun to Earth) space weather modeling system, enabling to combine (“couple”) various space weather models in an integrated tool, with the models located either locally or geographically distributed, so as to better understand the challenges in creating such an integrated environment. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. The physics-based models are installed on different compute clusters and can be run interactively and remotely and that can be coupled over the internet, using open source “high-level architecture” software, to make complex modeling chains involving models from the Sun to the Earth. Visualization tools have been integrated as “models” that can be coupled to any other integrated model with compatible output. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. The first operational version of the VSWMC is accessible via the SWE Portal and demonstrates its end-to-end simulation capability. Users interact via the front-end GUI and can interactively run complex coupled simulation models and view and retrieve the output, including standard visualizations, via the GUI. Hence, the VSWMC provides the capability to validate and compare model outputs.},

Tabulations from the Handbook for MAP 16 are the primary guide for the lower atmosphere and are supplemented by historical rocket and incoherent scatter data in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, and simplified local time and longitude variations. While month to month details cannot be completely represented, lower atmosphere temperature data are fit to an overall standard deviation of 3 K and pressure to 2\%. Comparison with rocket and other data indicates that the model represents current knowledge of the climatological average reasonably well, although there is some conflict as to details near the mesopause.},

	abstract = {Ideal magnetohydrodynamics is known to be inaccurate for the Earth's inner magnetosphere, where transport by gradient-curvature drift is nonnegligible compared to E × B drift. Most theoretical treatments of the inner plasma sheet and ring current, including the Rice Convection Model (RCM), treat the inner magnetospheric plasma in terms of guiding center drifts. The RCM assumes that the distribution function is isotropic, but particles with different energy invariants are treated as separate guiding center fluids. However, Peymirat and Fontaine [1994] developed a two-fluid picture of the inner magnetosphere, which utilizes modified forms of the conventional fluid equations, not guiding center drift equations. Heinemann [1999] argued theoretically that for inner magnetospheric conditions the fluid energy equation should include a heat flux term, which, in the case of Maxwellian plasma, was derived by Braginskii [1965]. We have now reconciled the Heinemann [1999] fluid approach with the RCM. The fluid equations, including the Braginskii heat flux, can be derived by taking appropriate moments of the RCM equations for the case of the Maxwellian distribution. The physical difference between the RCM formalism and the Heinemann [1999] fluid approach is that the RCM pretends that particles suffer elastic collisions that maintain the isotropy of the distribution function but do not change particle energies. The Heinemann [1999] fluid treatment makes a different physical approximation, namely that the collisions maintain local thermal equilibrium among the ions and separately among the electrons. For some simple cases, numerical results are presented that illustrate the differences in the predictions of the two formalisms, along with those of MHD, guiding center theory, and Peymirat and Fontaine [1994].},

Data points used in the present study cover a vast range of distances 4≲R≲70RE and comprise an unprecedentedly large number of measurements (a total of 36682 vector averages, almost twice as many as in our earlier data set). The data have been divided into groups corresponding to a sequence of Kp-index intervals, as well as different conditions in the solar wind. Mathematical representation of the magnetic field follows in its general features the approach developed in our earlier work, with some modifications.

	abstract = {On March 13, 1989, at 7 h 45 UT, Hydro-Québec experienced a complete black-out of its system due to a severe geomagnetic storm. Consequently, service was interrupted for many hours and overvoltages resulting from line openings cost 6.5 M\$ in material damages alone among a total of 13.2 M\$. In 1991, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) produced some effects and damages on the Radisson–Sandy Pond HVDC link. On March 24, at 21h55 UT, GIC larger than 110A were measured in one of two transformers in parallel (presumably, giving a total of 220 A) at Radisson substation which led to the loss of the HVDC link. The same thing happened on October 28, but this time with material damages to equipment. From these events, short-term studies led to the upgrading of operational processes, modifications of opening thresholds of Static Var Compensators and modifications of some filters at Radisson. Also an agreement was concluded with Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) for sending a warning alert to the Network Control Centre (CCR) before any anticipated severe geomagnetic storms. Among more long-term studies, in collaboration with GSC, we have installed 5 acquisition substations along a 250-km long copper telephone line in Abitibi, a site typical of Hydro-Québec facilities, and from 1992 to 1994 measured ground voltages and magnetic fields every 10s. The highest ground voltage measured at Louvicourt substation was ∼1.70V/km for 20s. Asymmetry measurement of line voltages, based on techniques developed at IREQ in the 1980s, have been upgraded, the number of installations has been increased (from 4 to 8) and functions like harmonic measurement have been added. Voltage asymmetries over a fixed threshold produce an alarm at the CCR, which reacts by taking security measures in network operation. During March 1989 and 1991 events, voltage asymmetry grew to 9.6\% and 15.5\%, respectively, at the Arnaud substation. A major change, for needs of network stability during short circuit or other contingencies, has been the installation of series compensation in 1996 into the Hydro-Québec 735-kV network. Since capacitors block DC current, the observed asymmetry has remained about 20\% of that observed before. So, now, we are confident that our network would survive the anticipated worst case GIC.},

	abstract = {Solar flares are one of the primary initiators of many space weather phenomena. Their fast initiation and orders-of-magnitude increase in high-energy electromagnetic radiation require true forecasting efforts. Today's probabilistic flare forecasting capability is arguably not very good. When faced with specific questions regarding timing and magnitude of impending flares in the context of a flare-productive sunspot group, short-range targeted predictions are beyond the present science's capabilities. Such shortcomings may be of most serious consequence in the context of extreme solar flares—situations where a catastrophic flare event is highly likely, but when it will occur is both unknown and of great importance. This situation points to the need for better identification of a unique physical parameter space in which solar flares occur, for identifying the relevant physical trigger (or triggers), for the ability to estimate the likelihood that a trigger's presence will produce an event, and what size an event is expected.},

The wealth of data collected provides a unique opportunity for testing coronal models. We develop a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the solar corona (from 1 to 30 solar radii) applicable to the WSM time period, using measurements of the photospheric magnetic field as boundary conditions for the calculation. We compare results from the computation with daily and synoptic white-light and emission images obtained from ground-based observations and the SOHO spacecraft and with solar wind measurements from the Ulysses and WIND spacecraft. The results from the MHD computation show good overall agreement with coronal and interplanetary structures, including the position and shape of the streamer belt, coronal hole boundaries, and the heliospheric current sheet. From the model, we can infer the source locations of solar wind properties measured in interplanetary space. We find that the slow solar wind typically maps back to near the coronal hole boundary, while the fast solar wind maps to regions deeper within the coronal holes. Quantitative disagreements between the MHD model and observations for individual features observed during Whole Sun Month give insights into possible improvements to the model.},

The coronal model provides data-driven solar wind plasma parameters at 0.1 AU by constructing a magnetic field model of the coronal large-scale magnetic field and employing empirical relations to determine the plasma state such as the solar wind speed and mass density. These are then used as boundary conditions to drive a three-dimensional time-dependent magnetohydrodynamics model of the inner heliosphere up to 2 AU. CMEs are injected into the ambient solar wind modeled using the cone model, with their parameters obtained from fits to imaging observations. In addition to detailing the modeling methodology, an initial validation run is presented.

The stability conditions of the semirelativistic MHD equations are also investigated in detail. This form of the MHD equations has a use beyond modeling flows with high Alfvén speeds. Even in cases with moderate Alfvén speeds, the semirelativistic form or certain approximations of it can be used to achieve accelerated numerical convergence to steady-state solutions by artificially reducing the speed of light, provided that the steady-state solutions of these equations are fully independent of the speed of light. Numerical tests are presented that demonstrate the behavior of solutions at high Alfvén speeds and the convergence acceleration that can be achieved when a steady-state solution is desired.},

The scheme is generalized to three-dimensional block-adaptive grids with Cartesian or generalized coordinates. The second order accurate discretization of the Hall term at grid resolution changes is described in detail. Both explicit and implicit time integration schemes are developed. The stability of the explicit time integration is ensured by including the whistler wave speed for the shortest discrete wave length into the numerical dissipation, but then second order accuracy requires the use of symmetric limiters in the total variation diminishing scheme. The implicit scheme employs a Newton–Krylov–Schwarz type approach, and can achieve significantly better efficiency than the explicit scheme with an appropriate preconditioner. The second order accuracy of the scheme is verified by numerical tests. The parallel scaling and robustness are demonstrated by three-dimensional simulations of planetary magnetospheres.},

To do so, we compare the simulation results of the model with a comprehensive suite of observations for Carrington rotations representative of the solar minimum conditions extending from the solar corona to the heliosphere up to the Earth. In the low corona (r {\textless} 1.25 ), we compare with EUV images from both Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A/EUVI and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and to three-dimensional (3D) tomographic reconstructions of the electron temperature and density based on these same data. We also compare the model to tomographic reconstructions of the electron density from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph observations (2.55 {\textless} r {\textless} 6.0). In the heliosphere, we compare model predictions of solar wind speed with velocity reconstructions from InterPlanetary Scintillation observations. For comparison with observations near the Earth, we use OMNI data. Our results show that the improved AWSoM model performs well in quantitative agreement with the observations between the inner corona and 1 au. The model now reproduces the fast solar wind speed in the polar regions. Near the Earth, our model shows good agreement with observations of solar wind velocity, proton temperature, and density. AWSoM offers an extensive application to study the solar corona and larger heliosphere in concert with current and future solar missions as well as being well suited for space weather predictions.},

	abstract = {We present a three-dimensional (3-D) numerical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model, describing the time-dependent expulsion of plasma and magnetic flux from the solar corona that resembles a coronal mass ejection (CME). We begin by developing a global steady-state model of the corona and solar wind that gives a reasonable description of the solar wind conditions near solar minimum. The model magnetic field possesses high-latitude coronal holes and closed field lines at low latitudes in the form of a helmet streamer belt with a current sheet at the solar equator. We further reproduce the fast and slow speed solar wind at high and low latitudes, respectively. Within this steady-state heliospheric model, conditions for a CME are created by superimposing the magnetic field and plasma density of the 3-D Gibson-Low flux rope inside the coronal streamer belt. The CME is launched by initial force imbalance within the flux rope resulting in its rapid acceleration to a speed of over 1000 km/s and then decelerates, asymptotically approaching a final speed near 600 km/s. The CME is characterized by the bulk expulsion of ∼1016 g of plasma from the corona with a maximum of ∼5 × 1031 ergs of kinetic energy. This energy is derived from the free magnetic energy associated with the cross-field currents, which is released as the flux rope expands. The dynamics of the CME are followed as it interacts with the bimodal solar wind. We also present synthetic white-light coronagraph images of the model CME, which show a two-part structure that can be compared with coronagraph observations of CMEs.},

	abstract = {A data-driven physical model of the energetic electrons in the Earth's radiation belts, called the Radiation Belt Environment (RBE) model, has been developed to understand Earth's radiation belt dynamics and to predict the radiation conditions found there. This model calculates radiation belt electron fluxes from 10 keV to 6 MeV in the inner magnetosphere. It takes into account the realistic, time-varying magnetic field and considers effects of wave-particle interactions with whistler mode chorus waves. The storm on 23–27 October 2002 is simulated and the temporal evolutions of the radial and pitch angle distributions of energetic electrons are examined. The calculated electron fluxes agree very well with particle data from the low-orbit SAMPEX and LANL geosynchronous satellites, when the wave-particle interactions are taken into account during storm recovery. Flux increases begin near the plasmapause and then diffuse outward to higher L shells, consistent with previous findings from statistical studies. A simplified version of the RBE model is now running in real time to provide nowcasting of the radiation belt environment. With further improvements and refinements, this model will have important value in both scientific and space weather applications.},

One of the primary motivations of the work is to support NOAA SWPC in their selection of the next numerical model that will be transitioned into operations. Six geomagnetic events and 12 geomagnetic observatories were selected for validation. While modeled and observed magnetic field time series are available for all 12 stations, the primary metrics analysis is based on six stations that were selected to represent the high-latitude and mid-latitude locations. Events-based analysis and the corresponding contingency tables were built for each event and each station. The elements in the contingency table were then used to calculate Probability of Detection (POD), Probability of False Detection (POFD) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS) for rigorous quantification of the models' performance. In this paper the summary results of the metrics analyses are reported in terms of POD, POFD and HSS. More detailed analyses can be carried out using the event by event contingency tables provided as an online appendix. An online interface built at CCMC and described in the supporting information is also available for more detailed time series analyses.},

The ionosphere allows magnetospheric currents to close, thereby allowing magnetospheric convection to occur. The amount of current which can be carried through the ionosphere is mainly determined by the ionospheric conductivity. This paper starts to quantify the nonlinear relationship between the ionospheric conductivity and the global state of the magnetosphere. It is found that the steady-state magnetosphere acts neither as a current nor as a voltage generator; a uniform Hall conductance can influence the potential pattern at low latitudes, but not at high latitude; the EUV generated conductance forces the currents to close in the sunlight, while the potential is large on the nightside; the solar generated Hall conductances cause a large asymmetry between the dawn and dusk potential, which effects the pressure distribution in the magnetosphere; a uniform polar cap potential removes some of this asymmetry; the potential difference between solar minimum and maximum is \&\#x223C;11\%; and the auroral precipitation can be related to the local field-aligned current through an exponential function.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} \textbf{Key words.} Ionosphere (ionosphere-magnetosphere interactions; modelling and forecasting; polar ionosphere){\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This and the following two papers report results of the first comprehensive computer simulation of the behavior of the earth's inner magnetosphere during a substorm-type event. Our computer model self-consistently computes electric fields, currents, and plasma distributions and velocities in the inner-magnetosphere/ionosphere system (L ≲10); parallel electric fields and ionospheric neutral winds are not included. In this paper, we derive the basic equations of the model, describe the inputs, and present an overview of results. The first appendix presents derivations of general, useful laws of bounce-averaged gradient, curvature, and drifts in a plasma with isotropic pitch angle distributions. A second appendix describes the numerical method used in our computer simulation. The succeeding two papers present analyses of model results and comparisons with data. The model was applied to a substorm-type event that occurred on September 19, 1976. Satellite data (primarily from the Air Force S3-2 satellite) were used extensively both for boundary conditions and for comparisons with model predictions. Other data were also used as input for our time dependent magnetic field and conductivity models. The S3-2 data for the event show some novel features, independent of the simulation. Dawn-dusk electric fields show a general correlation with east-west magnetic field perturbations. Unexpectedly, two of the passes display substantial regions of sunward plasma flow poleward of the main part of the region 1 Birkeland currents. The cross-polar cap potential drops computed from the data represent the first effort at satellite monitoring of this important parameter during various phases of a substorm, and show an important enhancement during the substorm. Numerical results from these first-try simulations are consistent with most of the established features of convection in the inner magnetosphere, such as generally sunward flow, shielding of the potential electric field for L {\textless}5, and the tendency for stronger electric fields on the duskside than on the dawnside. In addition, the model reproduces some typical substorm phenomena, such as energy-dependent particle injection with a dawndusk asymmetry and establishment of a partial ring current.},

The initial magnetic field for the model is based on magnetogram data from the Wilcox Solar Observatory, and the solar eruption is initiated by slowly evolving the boundary conditions until a critical point is reached where the configuration loses equilibrium. At this time, the field erupts, and a flux rope is ejected that achieves a maximum speed in excess of 1000 km s-1. The shock that forms in front of the rope reaches a fast-mode Mach number in excess of 4 and a compression ratio greater than 3 by the time it has traveled a distance of 5 R☉ from the surface. For such values, diffusive shock acceleration theory predicts a distribution of solar energetic protons with a cutoff energy of about 10 GeV. For this event, there appears to be no need to introduce an additional acceleration mechanism to account for solar energetic protons with energies below 10 GeV.},

	abstract = {We present a new version of the Alfvén wave solar model, a global model from the upper chromosphere to the corona and the heliosphere. The coronal heating and solar wind acceleration are addressed with low-frequency Alfvén wave turbulence. The injection of Alfvén wave energy at the inner boundary is such that the Poynting flux is proportional to the magnetic field strength. The three-dimensional magnetic field topology is simulated using data from photospheric magnetic field measurements. This model does not impose open-closed magnetic field boundaries; those develop self-consistently. The physics include the following. (1) The model employs three different temperatures, namely the isotropic electron temperature and the parallel and perpendicular ion temperatures. The firehose, mirror, and ion–cyclotron instabilities due to the developing ion temperature anisotropy are accounted for. (2) The Alfvén waves are partially reflected by the Alfvén speed gradient and the vorticity along the field lines. The resulting counter-propagating waves are responsible for the nonlinear turbulent cascade. The balanced turbulence due to uncorrelated waves near the apex of the closed field lines and the resulting elevated temperatures are addressed. (3) To apportion the wave dissipation to the three temperatures, we employ the results of the theories of linear wave damping and nonlinear stochastic heating. (4) We have incorporated the collisional and collisionless electron heat conduction. We compare the simulated multi-wavelength extreme ultraviolet images of CR2107 with the observations from STEREO/EUVI and the Solar Dynamics Observatory/AIA instruments. We demonstrate that the reflection due to strong magnetic fields in the proximity of active regions sufficiently intensifies the dissipation and observable emission.},

The realistic three-dimensional magnetic field is simulated using the data from the photospheric magnetic field measurements. The distinctive feature of the new model is incorporating MHD Alfvén wave turbulence. We assume this turbulence and its nonlinear dissipation to be the only momentum and energy source for heating the coronal plasma and driving the solar wind. The difference between the turbulence dissipation efficiency in coronal holes and that in closed field regions is because the nonlinear cascade rate degrades in strongly anisotropic (imbalanced) turbulence in coronal holes (no inward propagating wave), thus resulting in colder coronal holes, from which the fast solar wind originates. The detailed presentation of the theoretical model is illustrated with the synthetic images for multi-wavelength EUV emission compared with the observations from SDO AIA and STEREO EUVI instruments for the Carrington rotation 2107.},

	abstract = {The physical processes that heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind remain unknown after many years of study. Some have suggested that the wind is driven by waves and turbulence in open magnetic flux tubes, and others have suggested that plasma is injected into the open tubes by magnetic reconnection with closed loops. In order to test the latter idea, we developed Monte Carlo simulations of the photospheric “magnetic carpet” and extrapolated the time-varying coronal field. These models were constructed for a range of different magnetic flux imbalance ratios. Completely balanced models represent quiet regions on the Sun and source regions of slow solar wind streams. Highly imbalanced models represent coronal holes and source regions of fast wind streams. The models agree with observed emergence rates, surface flux densities, and number distributions of magnetic elements. Despite having no imposed supergranular motions in the models, a realistic network of magnetic “funnels” appeared spontaneously. We computed the rate at which closed field lines open up (i.e., recycling times for open flux), and we estimated the energy flux released in reconnection events involving the opening up of closed flux tubes. For quiet regions and mixed-polarity coronal holes, these energy fluxes were found to be much lower than that which is required to accelerate the solar wind. For the most imbalanced coronal holes, the energy fluxes may be large enough to power the solar wind, but the recycling times are far longer than the time it takes the solar wind to accelerate into the low corona. Thus, it is unlikely that either the slow or fast solar wind is driven by reconnection and loop-opening processes in the magnetic carpet.},

The collisions between the electrons and protons are taken into account as well as the anisotropic thermal heat conduction of the electrons. The solar wind is assumed to be accelerated by the Alfvén waves. In this paper, we do not consider the heating of closed magnetic loops and helmet streamers but do address the heating of the protons by the Kolmogorov dissipation of the Alfvén waves in open field-line regions. The inner boundary conditions for this solar wind model are obtained from observations and an empirical model. The Wang–Sheeley–Arge model is used to determine the Alfvén wave energy density at the inner boundary. The electron density and temperature at the inner boundary are obtained from the differential emission measure tomography applied to the extreme-ultraviolet images of the STEREO A and B spacecraft. This new solar wind model is validated for solar minimum Carrington rotation 2077 (2008 November 20 through December 17). Due to the very low activity during this rotation, this time period is suitable for comparing the simulated corotating interaction regions (CIRs) with in situ ACE/WIND data. Although we do not capture all MHD variables perfectly, we do find that the time of occurrence and the density of CIRs are better predicted than by our previous semi-empirical wind model in the SWMF that was based on a spatially reduced adiabatic index to account for the plasma heating.},

The computer model self-consistently computes electric fields and currents, as well as plasma distributions and velocities, in the inner-magnetosphere/ionosphere system. In the equatorial plane, the region modeled includes geocentric distances less than about the magnetopause standoff distance. Particle loss, parallel electric fields, and neutral winds are neglected. On the basis of solar wind parameters and the AL index as input, the model predicts the injection of plasma-sheet plasma to form a substantial storm time ring current. The total strength of the model-predicted ring current agrees accurately with the observed Dst index. Comparison of the model results with electric fields and Birkeland currents measured by S3-3 shows qualitative agreement but interesting quantitative discrepancies. During this event, region 1 currents, which in standard convection theory would connect to the outer magnetosphere, are observed as low as 60° invariant latitude at dawn and dusk. We examine the possibility that the magnetic field might be so highly inflated that 60° field lines extend to the outer magnetosphere. In the model, distortion of the inner edge of the plasma sheet by the magnetospheric compression associated with the sudden commencement temporarily disturbs the normal Birkeland-current pattern. The normal tendency for the plasma sheet's inner edge to shield low L values from the convection electric field is also temporarily disrupted. Normal Birkeland currents and shielding reassert themselves after about an hour. Time-integrated Joule heating in the model ionosphere over the first 5.5 hours of the storm main phase is about half the increase in model ring-current energy.},

	abstract = {Typical planetary and planetary satellite exospheres are in nonequilibrium conditions, which means that a distribution function that describes these environments is far from Maxwellian. It is even more true when considering transportation of energetic ions in planetary magnetospheres, making it necessary to solve the Boltzmann equation in order to capture kinetic effects when modeling evolution of the distribution function describing such environments. Among various numerical methods, the Monte Carlo approach is one of the most used one for solving kinetic equations. That is because of the relative simplicity of implementing and a high degree of flexibility in including new physical processes specific to a particular simulated environment. Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS) was developed as a general-purpose code for solving the Boltzmann equation in conditions typical for planetary and planetary satellite exospheres. Later, the code was generalized for modeling dusty gas, dust, and plasma, and for simulating transportation of solar energetic particles and galactic cosmic rays in planetary magnetospheres. Here, we present a brief overview of the design, list the implemented physics models, and outline the modeling capabilities of AMPS. The latter is supported by several examples of prior applications of the code.},

We argue that as long as the global and ion inertial scales remain well separated, (1) the overall global solution is not strongly sensitive to the value of the ion inertial scale, while (2) the ion inertial scale dynamics will also be similar to the original system, but it occurs at a larger spatial scale, and (3) structures at intermediate scales, such as magnetic islands, grow in a self-similar manner. To investigate the validity and limitations of our scaling hypotheses, we carry out many simulations of a two-dimensional magnetosphere with the magnetohydrodynamics with embedded particle-in-cell (MHD-EPIC) model. The PIC model covers the dayside reconnection site. The simulation results confirm that the hypotheses are true as long as the increased ion inertial length remains less than about 5\% of the magnetopause standoff distance. Since the theoretical arguments are general, we expect these results to carry over to three dimensions. The computational cost is reduced by the third and fourth powers of the scaling factor in two- and three-dimensional simulations, respectively, which can be many orders of magnitude. The present results suggest that global simulations that resolve kinetic scales for reconnection are feasible. This is a crucial step for applications to the magnetospheres of Earth, Saturn, and Jupiter and to the solar corona.},

Results from the Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the coupled MHD with embedded particle-in-cell (MHD-EPIC) models are compared. We find that under steady upstream conditions, magnetopause reconnection occurs in a nonsteady manner, and the energy partition between electrons and ions is different in the two models. Flux ropes of Ganymede's radius in length form on the magnetopause at a rate about 3 min and create spatiotemporal variations in plasma and field properties. Upon reaching proper grid resolutions, the MHD-EPIC model can resolve both electron and ion kinetics at the magnetopause and show localized nongyrotropic behavior inside the diffusion region. The estimated global reconnection rate from the models is about 80 kV with 60\% efficiency, and there is weak evidence of ∼1 min periodicity in the temporal variations due to the dynamic reconnection process.},

	abstract = {The Energy Conserving Semi-Implicit Method (ECSIM) introduced by Lapenta (2017) has many advantageous properties compared to the classical semi-implicit and explicit PIC methods. Most importantly, energy conservation eliminates the growth of the finite grid instability. We have implemented ECSIM in a different and more efficient manner than the original approach. More importantly, we have addressed two major shortcomings of the original ECSIM algorithm: there is no mechanism to enforce Gauss's law and there is no mechanism to reduce the numerical oscillations of the electric field. A classical approach to satisfy Gauss's law is to modify the electric field and its divergence using either an elliptic or a parabolic/hyperbolic correction based on the Generalized Lagrange Multiplier method. This correction, however, violates the energy conservation property, and the oscillations related to the finite grid instability reappear in the modified ECSIM scheme. We invented a new alternative approach: the particle positions are modified instead of the electric field in the correction step. Displacing the particles slightly does not change the energy conservation property, while it can satisfy Gauss's law by changing the charge density. We found that the new Gauss's Law satisfying Energy Conserving Semi-Implicit Method (GL-ECSIM) produces superior results compared to the original ECSIM algorithm. In some simulations, however, there are still some numerical oscillations present in the electric field. We attribute this to the simple finite difference discretization of the energy conserving implicit electric field solver. We modified the spatial discretization of the field solver to reduce these oscillations while only slightly violating the energy conservation properties. We demonstrate the improved quality of the GL-ECSIM method with several tests.},

To take self-consistently into account such multi-scale phenomena, we have developed a new simulation model by directly interlocking the fluid simulation of the magnetohyrdodynamics (MHD) model and the kinetic simulation of the particle-in-cell (PIC) model. The PIC domain is embedded in a small part of MHD domain. The both simulations are performed simultaneously in each domain and the bounded data are frequently exchanged each other to keep the consistency between the models.

Kinetic codes can properly take into account the kinetic effects, but they are orders of magnitude more expensive than the fluid codes due to the increased degrees of freedom. If the fluid description is acceptable in a large fraction of the computational domain, it makes sense to confine the kinetic model to the regions where kinetic effects are important. This coupled approach can be much more efficient than a pure kinetic model. The speed up is approximately the volume ratio of the full domain relative to the kinetic regions assuming that the kinetic code uses a uniform grid. This idea has been advocated by [1] but their coupling was limited to one dimension and they employed drastically different grid resolutions in the fluid and kinetic models. We describe a fully two-dimensional two-way coupling of a Hall MHD model BATS-R-US with an implicit Particle-in-Cell (PIC) model iPIC3D. The coupling can be performed with identical grid resolutions and time steps. We call this coupled computational plasma model MHD-EPIC (MHD with Embedded PIC regions). Our verification tests show that MHD-EPIC works accurately and robustly. We show a two-dimensional magnetosphere simulation as an illustration of the potential future applications of MHD-EPIC.},

	abstract = {AbstractMercury's comparatively weak intrinsic magnetic field and its close proximity to the Sun lead to a magnetosphere that undergoes more direct space-weathering interactions than other planets. A unique aspect of Mercury's interaction system arises from the large ratio of the scale of the planet to the scale of the magnetosphere and the presence of a large-size core composed of highly conducting material. Consequently, there is strong feedback between the planetary interior and the magnetosphere, especially under conditions of strong external forcing. Understanding the coupled solar wind-magnetosphere-interior interaction at Mercury requires not only analysis of observations but also a modeling framework that is both comprehensive and inclusive. We have developed a new global MHD model for Mercury in which the planetary interior is modeled as layers of different electrical conductivities that electromagnetically couple to the surrounding plasma environment. This new modeling capability allows us to characterize the dynamical response of Mercury to time-varying external conditions in a self-consistent manner. Comparison of our model results with observations by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft shows that the model provides a reasonably good representation of the global magnetosphere. To demonstrate the capability to model induction effects, we have performed idealized simulations in which Mercury's magnetosphere is impacted by a solar wind pressure enhancement. Our results show that due to the induction effect, Mercury's core exerts strong global influences on the way Mercury responds to changes in the external environment, including modifying the global magnetospheric structure and affecting the extent to which the solar wind directly impacts the surface. The global MHD model presented here represents a crucial step toward establishing a modeling framework that enables self-consistent characterization of Mercury's tightly coupled planetary interior-magnetosphere system.},

	abstract = {We identify and examine all MErcury Surface Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) crossings of Mercury's dayside magnetopause with magnetospheric field intensities ≥300 nT. The eight such events, which occurred under highly compressed magnetosphere conditions, are analyzed in the identical manner utilized by Slavin et al. (2014, https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020319). The results suggest that the eight highly compressed magnetosphere events represent the highest solar wind dynamic pressures for which the MESSENGER's orbit still passed below the magnetopause and provided measurements of the dayside magnetosphere. Using the magnetohydrodynamic model by Jia et al. (2015, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JA021143) that electromagnetically couples Mercury's interior with its magnetosphere, a series of global simulations are conducted to quantitatively characterize the response of Mercury's magnetosphere to solar wind forcing. Combining the MESSENGER observations with the simulations, we have obtained a consistent picture of how Mercury's dayside magnetospheric configuration is controlled, separately and in combination, by induction-driven shielding and reconnection-driven erosion. For solar wind pressures of ∼40–90 nPa, compared with the average ∼10–15 nPa at Mercury's orbit, the shielding effects of induction in Mercury's core in standing-off the solar wind typically exceed the erosion of the dayside magnetosphere due to reconnection for these events, most of which occurred under low magnetic shear conditions. For high magnetic shear across the magnetopause our simulation predicts that reconnection would dominate. Mercury's effective magnetic moment as inferred from magnetopause standoff distance ranges from 170 to 250 for these events. These findings are of crucial importance for understanding the space weathering at Mercury and its contribution to the generation of Mercury's exosphere.},

	abstract = {Global ionospheric total electron content (TEC) maps are widely utilized in research regarding ionospheric physics and the associated space weather impacts, so there is a great interest in the community in short-term ionosphere TEC forecasting. In this study, the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) is applied to forecast the 256 spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients that are traditionally used to construct global ionospheric maps (GIM). Multiple input data, including historical time series of the SH coefficients, solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux, disturbance storm time (Dst) index, and hour of the day, are used in the developed LSTM NN model. Different combinations of the above parameters have been used in constructing the LSTM NN model, and it is found that the model using all four parameters performs the best. Then the best performing LSTM model is used to forecast the SH coefficients, and the global hourly TEC maps are reproduced using the 256 predicted SH coefficients. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out with respect to the CODE GIM TEC. Results show that the first/second hour TEC root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.27/2.20 TECU during storm time and 0.86/1.51 TECU during quiet time, so the developed model performs well during both quiet and storm times. Moreover, typical ionospheric structures, such as equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) and storm-enhanced density (SED), are well reproduced in the predicted TEC maps during storm time. The developed model also shows competitive performance in predicting global TEC when compared to the persistence model and two empirical models (IRI-2016 and NeQuick-2).},

This delay can result in GPS positioning error. Thus it is important to monitor the TEC maps. The observed TEC maps have big patches of missingness in the ocean and scattered small areas of missingness on the land. In this paper, we propose several extensions of existing matrix completion algorithms to achieve TEC map reconstruction, accounting for spatial smoothness and temporal consistency while preserving important structures of the TEC maps. We call the proposed method Video Imputation with SoftImpute, Temporal smoothing and Auxiliary data (VISTA). Numerical simulations that mimic patterns of real data are given. We show that our proposed method achieves better reconstructed TEC maps as compared to existing methods in literature. Our proposed computational algorithm is general and can be readily applied for other problems besides TEC map reconstruction.},

The model relates the white-light appearance of the CME to its internal magnetic field, which takes the form of a closed bubble, filled with a partly anchored, twisted magnetic flux rope, and embedded in an otherwise open background field. The model is constructed by solving in closed form the time-dependent ideal MHD equations for a γ = 4/3 polytrope making use of a similarity assumption and the application of a mathematical stretching transformation in order to treat a complex field geometry with three-dimensional variations. The density distribution frozen into the expanding CME magnetic field is obtained. The scattered white light integrated along the line of sight shows the conspicuous three features often associated with CMEs as observed with white-light coronagraphs: a surrounding high-density region, an internal low-density cavity, and a high-density core. We also show how the orientation of this three-dimensional structure relative to the line of sight can give rise to a variety of different geometric appearances in white light. These images generated from a CME model in a realistic geometry offer an opportunity to directly compare theoretical predictions on CME shapes with observations of CMEs in white light.

The radiation belt (RB) model solves the convection–diffusion equation of the plasma in the energy range of 10keV to a few MeV. In stand-alone mode RBE uses Tsyganenko's empirical models for the magnetic field, and Weimer's empirical model for the ionospheric potential. In the SWMF the BATS-R-US model provides the time dependent magnetic field by efficiently tracing the closed magnetic field-lines and passing the geometrical and field strength information to RBE at a regular cadence. The ionosphere electrodynamics component uses a two-dimensional vertical potential solver to provide new potential maps to the RBE model at regular intervals. We discuss the coupling algorithm and show some preliminary results with the coupled code. We run our newly coupled model for periods of steady solar wind conditions and compare our results to the RB model using an empirical magnetic field and potential model. We also simulate the RB for an active time period and find that there are substantial differences in the RB model results when changing either the magnetic field or the electric field, including the creation of an outer belt enhancement via rapid inward transport on the time scale of tens of minutes.},

To mitigate this limitation, we have added multi-threaded OpenMP parallelization to the previous pure MPI implementation. We opted to use a coarse-grained approach by making the loops over grid blocks multi-threaded and have succeeded in making BATS-R-US an efficient hybrid parallel code with modest changes in the source code while preserving the performance. Good weak scalings up to hundreds of thousands of cores were achieved both for explicit and implicit time stepping schemes. This parallelization strategy greatly extended the possible simulation scale from 16,000 cores to more than 500,000 cores with 2GB/core memory on the Blue Waters supercomputer. Our work also revealed significant performance issues for some of the compilers when the code is compiled with the OpenMP library, probably related to the less efficient optimization of a complex multi-threaded region.},

The MHD code provides a time-evolving magnetic field model for the RCM as well as continuously updated boundary conditions for the electric potential and plasma. The RCM computes the distribution functions of inner magnetospheric particles, including transport of inner plasmasheet and ring current particles by gradient/curvature drifts; it thus calculates more accurate inner magnetospheric pressures, which are frequently passed to the MHD model and used to nudge the MHD values. Results are presented for an initial run with the coupled code for the case of uniform ionospheric conductance with steady solar wind and southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The results are compared with those for a run of the MHD code alone. The coupled-code run shows significantly higher inner magnetospheric particle pressures. It also exhibits several well-established characteristics of inner magnetospheric electrodynamics, including strong region-2 Birkeland currents and partial shielding of the inner magnetosphere from the main force of the convection electric field. A sudden northward turning of the IMF causes the ring current to become more nearly symmetric. The inner magnetosphere exhibits an overshielding (dusk-to-dawn) electric field that begins about 10 min after the northward turning reaches the magnetopause and lasts just over an hour.},

	abstract = {Seven schemes to maintain the ∇·B=0 constraint numerically are compared. All these algorithms can be combined with shock-capturing Godunov type base schemes. They fall into three categories: the eight-wave formulation maintains the constraint to truncation error, the projection scheme enforces the constraint in some discretization by projecting the magnetic field, while the five different versions of the constrained transport/central difference type schemes conserve ∇·B to machine accuracy in some discretization for every grid cell. It is shown that the three constrained transport algorithms, which have been introduced recently, can be recast into pure finite volume schemes, and the staggered representation of the magnetic field is unnecessary. Another two new and simple central difference based algorithms are introduced. The properties of the projection scheme are discussed in some detail, and I prove that it has the same order of accuracy as the base scheme even for discontinuous solutions. I describe a flexible and efficient implementation of the projection scheme using conjugate gradient type iterative methods. Generalizations to resistive MHD, to axial symmetry, and to non-Cartesian grids are given for all schemes. The theoretical discussion is followed by numerical tests, where the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the seven schemes and the base scheme can be directly compared. All simulations are done with the Versatile Advection Code, in which several shock-capturing base schemes are implemented. Although the eight-wave formulation usually works correctly, one of the numerical tests demonstrates that its non-conservative nature can occasionally produce incorrect jumps across strong discontinuities. Based on a large number of tests, the projection scheme, one of the new central difference based schemes, and one of the constrained transport schemes are found to be the most accurate and reliable among the examined methods.},

The structure of the eighth wave is not immediately obvious from the governing equations as they are usually written, but arises from a modification of the equations that is presented in this paper. The addition of the eighth wave allows multi-dimensional MHD problems to be solved without the use of staggered grids or a projection scheme, one or the other of which was necessary in previous work on upwind schemes for MHD. A test problem made up of a shock tube with rotated initial conditions is solved to show that the two-dimensional code yields answers consistent with the one-dimensional methods developed previously.},

The source terms that couple the fluids and fields are treated implicitly to relax the stiffness. The algorithm is validated with the coplanar Riemann problem, Langmuir plasma oscillations, and the electromagnetic shock problem that has been simulated with the MHD plasma model.

	abstract = {We present a six-moment multi-fluid model, which solves the governing equations for both ions and electrons, with pressure anisotropy along and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, as well as the complete set of Maxwell equations. This set of equations includes the Hall effect, different temperatures for different species and pressure anisotropy. It is more comprehensive than the five-moment equations with isotropic pressures and significantly less expensive than the ten-moment equations with a full pressure tensors. Similarly to the five- and ten-moment equations, the wave speeds are naturally limited by the speed of light, which eliminates the issue of unlimited whistler wave speeds present in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It is also possible to simulate multiple negatively charged fluids, which cannot be done in MHD models. The six-moment model is a reasonable description of the plasma outside magnetic reconnection regions and therefore well-suited to be coupled with an embedded particle-in-cell model that covers the reconnection region. Our numerical implementation uses a point-implicit scheme for the stiff source terms, and we use a second-order accurate Rusanov-type scheme with carefully selected wave speeds. For the plasma variables and the magnetic field the maximum wave speed is based on the fast magnetosonic speed of MHD with anisotropic pressures that we derive. For the electric field related variables the speed of light is used. The divergence of the magnetic field and Gauss's law are controlled with a hyperbolic-parabolic scheme. We present a number of numerical tests to demonstrate that this numerical model is robust without being excessively diffusive.},

When resistivity is relatively large and magnetic energy is comparable or smaller than kinetic energy, the convection motion maintains its well-organized structure. However, when resistivity is small and magnetic energy becomes larger than kinetic energy, the well-organized convection motion is highly irregular. The magnetic field is organized in two ways. One is the concentration of component parallel to the rotation axis and the other is the concentration of perpendicular component. The parallel component tends to be confined inside anticyclonic columnar convection cells, while the perpendicular component is confined outside convection cells.},

	abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent, self-consistent numerical solution of the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations that describe thermal convection and magnetic field generation in a rapidly rotating spherical fluid shell with a solid conducting inner core. This solution, which serves as a crude analog for the geodynamo, is a self-sustaining supercritical dynamo that has maintained a magnetic field for three magnetic diffusion times, roughly 40 000 years. Fluid velocity in the outer core reaches a maximum of 0.4 cm s−1, and at times the magnetic field can be as large as 560 gauss. Magnetic energy is usually about 4000 times greater than the kinetic energy of the convection that maintains it. Viscous and magnetic coupling to both the inner core below and the mantle above cause time-dependent variations in their respective rotation rates; the inner core usually rotates faster than the mantle and decadal variations in the length of the day of the mantle are similar to those observed for the Earth. The pattern and amplitude of the radial magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and its secular variation are also similar to the Earth's. The maximum amplitudes of the longitudinally averaged temperature gradient, shear flow, helicity, and magnetic field oscillate between the northern and southern hemispheres on a time scale of a few thousand years. However, only once in many attempts does the field succeed in reversing its polarity because the field in the inner core, which has the opposite polarity to the field in most of the outer core, usually does not have enough time to reverse before the field in the outer core changes again. One successful magnetic field reversal occurs near the end of our simulation.},

	abstract = {In 1995, two groups [Kageyama et al., 1995; Glatzmaier and Roberts, 1995a, 1995b] reported results of numerical integrations of fully three-dimensional, fully nonlinear dynamos. Their papers were precursors of a stream of such models that have focused particularly on the geodynamo. They provide us, in unprecedented detail, with spectacular realizations of interesting geomagnetic field behaviors, such as secular variation and even polarity reversals. The proliferation of models has, however, created some confusion and apparently conflicting results. This can be partly attributed to the different ways in which different groups have modeled the core, normalized their equations, defined their dimensionless parameters, chosen their boundary conditions, and selected their energy sources. This has made it difficult to compare the results of different simulations directly. In this paper, we first try, as far as possible, to overcome this difficulty, so that all reported results can be compared on common ground. We then review the results, emphasizing three major topics: (1) onset and evolution of convection, (2) character of the magnetic field generated, and (3) comparison with the observed geomagnetic field. Although there are large differences in the way that the simulations are defined, the magnetic fields that they generate have some surprising similarities. The fields are dominated by the axial dipole. In some models they are most strongly generated in shear layers near the upper and lower boundaries and near the tangent cylinder, an imaginary surface touching the inner core on its equator. Convection rolls occur within which a type of the α effect distorts the toroidal field lines to create poloidal magnetic field. Some features of the models are found to strongly affect the fields that they produce. In particular, the boundary conditions defining the energy flow (e.g., an inhomogeneous heat flux or distribution of buoyancy sources) are very influential and have been extensively studied. They change the frequency and the mode of magnetic polarity reversals as well as the ratio in strengths of the dipole and nondipole moments. As the ultimate goal of geodynamo simulations is to explain the features of the real geomagnetic field, it is essential that proper comparisons be made between simulation results and observations. It is remarkable that polarity reversals reminiscent of the paleomagnetically observed field reversals have already been simulated by some of the models. Other features such as drift of the field, its secular variation, and statistical properties of Gauss coefficients are discussed in this paper and are compared with observations. These comparisons are rather primitive, not only because self-consistent dynamo models are still too new and too few but also because many of the observations (and especially the paleomagnetic data) are themselves not yet reliable or decisive enough. The aim of the third part of this paper is therefore more to demonstrate the potential use of simulations than to elucidate the nature of geomagnetic field generation.},

	abstract = {The geomagnetic field displays complicated variations over a broad range of frequencies. These variations can be decomposed by frequency and linked to physical processes using frequency domain spectral methods. These spectral methods are well developed but have not previously been applied to study the energy balance of geodynamo simulations. We illustrate their potential by analyzing output from numerical dynamo simulations that have previously been studied for their apparently Earth-like properties. We show that high coherence between variations in axial dipole energy at the outer boundary of the simulation and total magnetic energy within the fluid shell occur at frequencies below ∼0.1 kyr−1. This suggests that paleomagnetically-observable signals with periods exceeding 10 kyrs contain information about magnetic energy changes in the bulk core. We then use spectral analysis to investigate differences in the rate of growth and decay of the axial dipole field. This behaviour, characterised by rapid growth and slow decay, is observed when signals with frequencies higher than 0.03 kyr−1 have been filtered out. The origin of this asymmetric growth and decay is assessed using coherence spectra between rates of change in kinetic and magnetic energy, ohmic and viscous dissipation, and work done by the buoyancy and Lorentz forces. We show that asymmetry is associated with an imbalance between ohmic dissipation and work done by the Lorentz force; when changes in magnetic energy are more coherent with ohmic dissipation the field grows rapidly and decay slowly. Variations in Ohmic dissipation reflect changes in field strength in our models, while changes in viscous dissipation are associated with amplitude fluctuations of the large-scale flow that exists on millennial timescales. Our work shows that spectral analysis coupling observable and global products of the dynamo process can elucidate the physical origin of periodic processes occurring on timescales exceeding 10 kyrs.},

Methodical studies of the Earth's field started in 1600 with William Gilbert's De Magnete [Gilbert, 1600] and continued with the work of (among others) Edmond Halley, Charles Augustin de Coulomb, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and Edward Sabine. The discovery of electromagnetism by Hans Christian Oersted and André-Marie Ampére led Michael Faraday to the notion of fluid dynamos, and the observation of sunspot magnetism by George Ellery Hale led Sir Joseph Larmor in 1919 to the idea that such dynamos could sustain themselves naturally in convecting conducting fluids. From that came modern dynamo theory, of both the solar and terrestrial magnetic fields. Paleomagnetic studies revealed that the Earth's dipole had undergone reversals in the distant past, and these became the critical evidence in establishing plate tectonics. Finally, the recent availability of scientific spacecraft has demonstrated the intricacy of the Earth's distant magnetic field, as well as the existence of magnetic fields associated with other planets and with satellites in our solar system.},

	abstract = {With the accumulation of coronal mass ejection (CME) observations by coronagraphs, automatic detection and tracking of CMEs has proven to be crucial. The excellent performance of the convolutional neural network in image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks motivates us to apply it to CME detection and tracking as well. We developed a new tool for CME Automatic detection and tracking with MachinE Learning (CAMEL) techniques. The system is a three-module pipeline. It is first a supervised image classification problem. We solve it by training a neural network LeNet with training labels obtained from an existing CME catalog. Those images containing CME structures are flagged as CME images. Next, to identify the CME region in each CME-flagged image, we use deep descriptor transforming to localize the common object in an image set. A following step is to apply the graph cut technique to finely tune the detected CME region. To track the CME in an image sequence, the binary images with detected CME pixels are converted from a cartesian to a polar coordinate. A CME event is labeled if it can move in at least two frames and reach the edge of the coronagraph field of view. For each event, a few fundamental parameters are derived. The results of four representative CMEs with various characteristics are presented and compared with those from four existing automatic and manual catalogs. We find that CAMEL can detect more complete and weaker structures and has better performance to catch a CME as early as possible.},

The event was also observed by the EUI/FSI imager on board Solar Orbiter, as well as by other space-based coronagraphs, such as STEREO-A/COR2 and SOHO/LASCO/C2, whose images are combined here with Metis data.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Different images are analysed here to reconstruct the 3D orientation of the expanding CME flux rope using the graduated cylindrical shell model. This also allows us to identify the possible location of the source region. Measurements of the CME kinematics allow us to quantify the expected Doppler dimming in the Ly-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} channel.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Observations show that most CME features seen in the visible-light images are also seen in the Ly-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} images, although some features in the latter channel appear more structured than their visible-light counterparts. We estimated the expansion velocity of this event to be below 140 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. Hence, these observations can be understood by assuming that Doppler dimming effects do not strongly reduce the Ly-{\textless}i{\textgreater}α{\textless}i/{\textgreater} emission from the CME. These velocities are comparable with or smaller than the radial velocities inferred from the same data in a similar coronal structure on the east side of the Sun.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The first observations by Metis of a CME demonstrate the capability of the instrument to provide valuable and novel information on the structure and dynamics of these coronal events.

A few representative models of each category are examined to illustrate the principles involved.

	abstract = {This work investigates how magnetic reconnection affects the acceleration of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and how the acceleration in turn affects the reconnection process. To model the CME process, we use a two-dimensional flux rope model, which drives the ejection by means of a catastrophic loss of mechanical equilibrium. Our model provides a method for relating the motion of the ejected material to the reconnection rate in the current sheet created by the erupting field. In the complete absence of reconnection the tension force associated with the current sheet is always strong enough to prevent the flux rope from escaping from the Sun. However, our results imply that even a fairly small reconnection rate is sufficient to allow the flux rope to escape. Specifically, for a coronal density model that decreases exponentially with height we find that average Alfvén Mach number MA for the inflow into the reconnection site can be as small as MA = 0.005 and still be fast enough to give a plausible eruption. The best fit to observations is obtained by assuming an inflow rate on the order of MA ≈ 0.1. With this value the energy output matches the temporal behavior inferred for the long duration events often associated with CMEs. The model also suggests an explanation for the peculiar motion of giant X-ray arches reported by Svestka et al. [1995, 1997]. X-ray arches are the large loops associated with CMEs which are similar in form to “post”-flare loops, but they have an upward motion that is often different. Instead of continually slowing with time, the arches move upward at a rate that remains nearly constant or may even increase with time. Here we show how the difference can be explained by reversal of the gradient of the coronal Alfvén speed with height.},

Red-shifted emission streaks of Hα line are found at the initial phase of almost all flares which occur near the disk center, and are considered to be substantial features of the red asymmetry. It is found that a downward motion in the flare chromospheric region is the cause of the red-shifted emission streak. The downward motion abruptly increases at the onset of a flare, attains its maximum velocity of about 40 to 100 km s-1 shortly before the impulsive peak of the microwave burst, and rapidly decreases before the intensity of Hα line reaches its maximum. Referring to the numerical simulations made by Livshits et al. (1981) and Somov et al. (1982), we conclude that the conspicuous red-asymmetry or the red-shifted emission streak of Hα line is due to the downward motion of the compressed chromospheric flare region produced by the impulsive heating by energetic electron beam or thermal conduction.},

	abstract = {Over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a changing business model for higher education itself. Furthermore, decreased discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH, CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding from all sources—the combination of perverse incentives and decreased funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.},

	abstract = {This review focuses on the processes that energize and trigger M- and X-class solar flares and associated flux-rope destabilizations. Numerical modeling of specific solar regions is hampered by uncertain coronal-field reconstructions and by poorly understood magnetic reconnection; these limitations result in uncertain estimates of field topology, energy, and helicity. The primary advances in understanding field destabilizations therefore come from the combination of generic numerical experiments with interpretation of sets of observations. These suggest a critical role for the emergence of twisted flux ropes into pre-existing strong field for many, if not all, of the active regions that produce M- or X-class flares. The flux and internal twist of the emerging ropes appear to play as important a role in determining whether an eruption will develop predominantly as flare, confined eruption, or CME, as do the properties of the embedding field. Based on reviewed literature, I outline a scenario for major flares and eruptions that combines flux-rope emergence, mass draining, near-surface reconnection, and the interaction with the surrounding field. Whether deterministic forecasting is in principle possible remains to be seen: to date no reliable such forecasts can be made. Large-sample studies based on long-duration, comprehensive observations of active regions from their emergence through their flaring phase are needed to help us better understand these complex phenomena.},

	abstract = {Solar eruptive phenomena embrace a variety of eruptions, including flares, solar energetic particles, and radio bursts. Since the vast majority of these are associated with the eruption, development, and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we focus on CME observations in this review. CMEs are a key aspect of coronal and interplanetary dynamics. They inject large quantities of mass and magnetic flux into the heliosphere, causing major transient disturbances. CMEs can drive interplanetary shocks, a key source of solar energetic particles and are known to be the major contributor to severe space weather at the Earth. Studies over the past decade using the data sets from (among others) the SOHO, TRACE, Wind, ACE, STEREO, and SDO spacecraft, along with ground-based instruments, have improved our knowledge of the origins and development of CMEs at the Sun and how they contribute to space weather at Earth. SOHO, launched in 1995, has provided us with almost continuous coverage of the solar corona over more than a complete solar cycle, and the heliospheric imagers SMEI (2003–2011) and the HIs (operating since early 2007) have provided us with the capability to image and track CMEs continually across the inner heliosphere. We review some key coronal properties of CMEs, their source regions and their propagation through the solar wind. The LASCO coronagraphs routinely observe CMEs launched along the Sun-Earth line as halo-like brightenings. STEREO also permits observing Earth-directed CMEs from three different viewpoints of increasing azimuthal separation, thereby enabling the estimation of their three-dimensional properties. These are important not only for space weather prediction purposes, but also for understanding the development and internal structure of CMEs since we view their source regions on the solar disk and can measure their in-situ characteristics along their axes. Included in our discussion of the recent developments in CME-related phenomena are the latest developments from the STEREO and LASCO coronagraphs and the SMEI and HI heliospheric imagers.},

The bulk of plasma with a mass of ∼ 1011,1013 kg is hauled up all the way out to the interplanetary space with a typical velocity of several hundred or even more than 1000 km s−1, with a chance to impact our Earth, resulting in hazardous space weather conditions. They involve many other much smaller-sized solar eruptive phenomena, such as X-ray sigmoids, filament/prominence eruptions, solar flares, plasma heating and radiation, particle acceleration, EIT waves, EUV dimmings, Moreton waves, solar radio bursts, and so on. It is believed that, by shedding the accumulating magnetic energy and helicity, they complete the last link in the chain of the cycling of the solar magnetic field. In this review, I try to explicate our understanding on each stage of the fantastic phenomenon, including their pre-eruption structure, their triggering mechanisms and the precursors indicating the initiation process, their acceleration and propagation. Particular attention is paid to clarify some hot debates, e.g., whether magnetic reconnection is necessary for the eruption, whether there are two types of CMEs, how the CME frontal loop is formed, and whether halo CMEs are special.},

There is a particular focus on their global properties, as opposed to the microphysics such as that needed for magnetic reconnection or particle acceleration as such. Indeed solar flares will always remain in the domain of remote sensing, so we cannot observe the microscales directly and must understand the basic physics entirely via the global properties plus theoretical inference. The global observables include the general energetics—radiation in flares and mass loss in coronal mass ejections (CMEs)—and the formation of different kinds of ejection and global wave disturbance: the type II radio-burst exciter, the Moreton wave, the EIT “wave”, and the “sunquake” acoustic waves in the solar interior. Flare radiation and CME kinetic energy can have comparable magnitudes, of order 1032 erg each for an X-class event, with the bulk of the radiant energy in the visible-UV continuum. We argue that the impulsive phase of the flare dominates the energetics of all of these manifestations, and also point out that energy and momentum in this phase largely reside in the electromagnetic field, not in the observable plasma.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines the current understanding of solar flares, mainly focused on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes responsible for producing a flare. Observations show that flares are one of the most explosive phenomena in the atmosphere of the Sun, releasing a huge amount of energy up to about 1032 erg on the timescale of hours. Flares involve the heating of plasma, mass ejection, and particle acceleration that generates high-energy particles. The key physical processes for producing a flare are: the emergence of magnetic field from the solar interior to the solar atmosphere (flux emergence), local enhancement of electric current in the corona (formation of a current sheet), and rapid dissipation of electric current (magnetic reconnection) that causes shock heating, mass ejection, and particle acceleration. The evolution toward the onset of a flare is rather quasi-static when free energy is accumulated in the form of coronal electric current (field-aligned current, more precisely), while the dissipation of coronal current proceeds rapidly, producing various dynamic events that affect lower atmospheres such as the chromosphere and photosphere. Flares manifest such rapid dissipation of coronal current, and their theoretical modeling has been developed in accordance with observations, in which numerical simulations proved to be a strong tool reproducing the time-dependent, nonlinear evolution of a flare. We review the models proposed to explain the physical mechanism of flares, giving an comprehensive explanation of the key processes mentioned above. We start with basic properties of flares, then go into the details of energy build-up, release and transport in flares where magnetic reconnection works as the central engine to produce a flare.},

Today, it is known that the Sun produces eruptive flares, filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections and failed eruptions; all thought to be due to a release of energy stored in the coronal magnetic field during its drastic reconfiguration. This review discusses the observations and physical mechanisms behind this eruptive activity, with a view to making an assessment of the current capability of forecasting these events for space weather risk and impact mitigation. Whilst a wealth of observations exist, and detailed models have been developed, there still exists a need to draw these approaches together. In particular more realistic models are encouraged in order to asses the full range of complexity of the solar atmosphere and the criteria for which an eruption is formed. From the observational side, a more detailed understanding of the role of photospheric flows and reconnection is needed in order to identify the evolutionary path that ultimately means a magnetic structure will erupt.},

	abstract = {Eruptions, flares, and coronal mass ejection (CMEs) are due to physical phenomena mainly driven by an initially force-free current-carrying magnetic field. We review some key observations relevant to the current theoretical trigger mechanisms of the eruption and to the energy release via reconnection. Sigmoids observed in X-rays and UV, as well as the pattern (double J-shaped) of electric currents in the photosphere show clear evidence of the existence of currents parallel to the magnetic field and can be the signature of a flux rope that is detectable in CMEs. The magnetic helicity of filaments and active regions is an interesting indirectly measurable parameter because it can quantify the twist of the flux rope. On the other hand, the magnetic helicity of the solar structures allows us to associate solar eruptions and magnetic clouds in the heliosphere. The magnetic topology analysis based on the 3D magnetic field extrapolated from vector magnetograms is a good tool for identifying the reconnection locations (null points and/or the 3D large volumes – hyperbolic flux tube, HFT). Flares are associated more with quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) and HFTs than with a single null point, which is a relatively rare case. We review various mechanisms that have been proposed to trigger CMEs and their observable signatures: by “breaking” the field lines overlying the flux rope or by reconnection below the flux rope to reduce the magnetic tension, or by letting the flux rope to expand until it reaches a minimum threshold height (loss of equilibrium or torus instability). Additional mechanisms are commonly operating in the solar atmosphere. Examples of observations are presented throughout the article and are discussed in this framework.},

We have to observe and model the vector magnetic field to understand the structures and physical mechanisms of these solar activities. Vector magnetic fields on the photosphere are routinely observed via the polarized light, and inferred with the inversion of Stokes profiles. To analyze these vector magnetic fields, we need first to remove the 180° ambiguity of the transverse components and correct the projection effect. Then, the vector magnetic field can be served as the boundary conditions for a force-free field modeling after a proper preprocessing. The photospheric velocity field can also be derived from a time sequence of vector magnetic fields. Three-dimensional magnetic field could be derived and studied with theoretical force-free field models, numerical nonlinear force-free field models, magnetohydrostatic models, and magnetohydrodynamic models. Magnetic energy can be computed with three-dimensional magnetic field models or a time series of vector magnetic field. The magnetic topology is analyzed by pinpointing the positions of magnetic null points, bald patches, and quasi-separatrix layers. As a well conserved physical quantity, magnetic helicity can be computed with various methods, such as the finite volume method, discrete flux tube method, and helicity flux integration method. This quantity serves as a promising parameter characterizing the activity level of solar active regions.},

	abstract = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares are the large-scale and most energetic eruptive phenomena in our solar system and able to release a large quantity of plasma and magnetic flux from the solar atmosphere into the solar wind. When these high-speed magnetized plasmas along with the energetic particles arrive at the Earth, they may interact with the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and seriously affect the safety of human high-tech activities in outer space. The travel time of a CME to 1 AU is about 1–3 days, while energetic particles from the eruptions arrive even earlier. An efficient forecast of these phenomena therefore requires a clear detection of CMEs/flares at the stage as early as possible. To estimate the possibility of an eruption leading to a CME/flare, we need to elucidate some fundamental but elusive processes including in particular the origin and structures of CMEs/flares. Understanding these processes can not only improve the prediction of the occurrence of CMEs/flares and their effects on geospace and the heliosphere but also help understand the mass ejections and flares on other solar-type stars. The main purpose of this review is to address the origin and early structures of CMEs/flares, from multi-wavelength observational perspective. First of all, we start with the ongoing debate of whether the pre-eruptive configuration, i.e., a helical magnetic flux rope (MFR), of CMEs/flares exists before the eruption and then emphatically introduce observational manifestations of the MFR. Secondly, we elaborate on the possible formation mechanisms of the MFR through distinct ways. Thirdly, we discuss the initiation of the MFR and associated dynamics during its evolution toward the CME/flare. Finally, we come to some conclusions and put forward some prospects in the future.},

	abstract = {The basis for the application of Thomson scattering to the analysis of coronagraph images has been laid decades ago.Even though the basic formulation is undebated, a discussion has grown in recent years about the spatial distribution of Thomson scatter sensitivity in the corona and the inner heliosphere. These notes are an attempt to clarify the understanding of this topic. We reformulate the classical scattering calculations in a more transparent way using modern SI-compatible quantities extended to field correlation matrices. The resulting concise formulation is easily extended to the case of relativistic electrons. For relativistic electrons we calculate the Stokes parameters of the scattered radiation and determine changes in degree and orientation of its polarisation, blue-shift and radiant intensities depending on the electron velocity magnitude and direction. We discuss the probability to see these relativistic effects in white-light coronagraph observations of the solar corona. Many mathematical and some basic physical ingredients are made explicit in several chapters of the appendix.},

It is hoped that the material may prove useful to most graduate students in astrophysics, while solar physicists may find some topics of interest and value to them. The book contains 12 chapters and begins with three descriptive chapters that provide the casual reader with a concept of the corona as it is evident through more or less direct observation. Topics covered include the development of coronal science, observational techniques, and observational aspects of the corona. The next chapter discusses methods of analyzing coronal data. Subsequent chapters present theoretical considerations as they are applicable to the corona. These combine theory with observation to provide a description of the various aspects of the corona. The final chapter is a combination of established ideas and speculation on the place of the corona in the universe.},

	abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called "enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops" (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type—in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

The basis of EB℡ is the modeling of mass exchange between the corona and transition region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EB℡ are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EB℡ is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed. A single run takes a few seconds on a contemporary laptop.},

	abstract = {The question of what heats the solar corona remains one of the most important problems in astrophysics. Finding a definitive solution involves a number of challenging steps, beginning with an identification of the energy source and ending with a prediction of observable quantities that can be compared directly with actual observations. Critical intermediate steps include realistic modeling of both the energy release process (the conversion of magnetic stress energy or wave energy into heat) and the response of the plasma to the heating. A variety of difficult issues must be addressed: highly disparate spatial scales, physical connections between the corona and lower atmosphere, complex microphysics, and variability and dynamics. Nearly all of the coronal heating mechanisms that have been proposed produce heating that is impulsive from the perspective of elemental magnetic flux strands. It is this perspective that must be adopted to understand how the plasma responds and radiates. In our opinion, the most promising explanation offered so far is Parker's idea of nanoflares occurring in magnetic fields that become tangled by turbulent convection. Exciting new developments include the identification of the “secondary instability” as the likely mechanism of energy release and the demonstration that impulsive heating in sub-resolution strands can explain certain observed properties of coronal loops that are otherwise very difficult to understand. Whatever the detailed mechanism of energy release, it is clear that some form of magnetic reconnection must be occurring at significant altitudes in the corona (above the magnetic carpet), so that the tangling does not increase indefinitely. This article outlines the key elements of a comprehensive strategy for solving the coronal heating problem and warns of obstacles that must be overcome along the way.},

For decades, the problem has been known as the coronal heating problem, but it is now clear that ‘coronal heating’ cannot be treated or explained in isolation and that the heating of the whole solar atmosphere must be studied as a highly coupled system. The magnetic field of the star is known to play a key role, but, despite significant advancements in solar telescopes, computing power and much greater understanding of theoretical mechanisms, the question of which mechanism or mechanisms are the dominant supplier of energy to the chromosphere and corona is still open. Following substantial recent progress, we consider the most likely contenders and discuss the key factors that have made, and still make, determining the actual (coronal) heating mechanism (or mechanisms) so difficult.},

	abstract = {The solar dynamo continues to pose a challenge to observers and theoreticians. Observations of the solar surface reveal a magnetic field with a complex, hierarchical structure consisting of widely different scales. Systematic features such as the solar cycle, the butterfly diagram, and Hale's polarity laws point to the existence of a deep-rooted large-scale magnetic field. At the other end of the scale are magnetic elements and small-scale mixed-polarity magnetic fields. In order to explain these phenomena, dynamo theory provides all the necessary ingredients including the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$effect, magnetic field amplification by differential rotation, magnetic pumping, turbulent diffusion, magnetic buoyancy, flux storage, stochastic variations and nonlinear dynamics. Due to advances in helioseismology, observations of stellar magnetic fields and computer capabilities, significant progress has been made in our understanding of these and other aspects such as the role of the tachocline, convective plumes and magnetic helicity conservation. However, remaining uncertainties about the nature of the deep-seated toroidal magnetic field and the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$effect, and the forbidding range of length scales of the magnetic field and the flow have thus far prevented the formulation of a coherent model for the solar dynamo. A preliminary evaluation of the various dynamo models that have been proposed seems to favor a buoyancy-driven or distributed scenario. The viewpoint proposed here is that progress in understanding the solar dynamo and explaining the observations can be achieved only through a combination of approaches including local numerical experiments and global mean-field modeling.},

During this period many meetings have been held, and several books and proceedings have been published, all dealing with specific aspects of solar prominences. However, no unifying and comprehensive accord has appeared. Recently some of my colleagues suggested that the time was ripe for a new addition of Solar Prominences, and Kluwer Academic Publishers wanted to pub­ lish such a book. I, therefore, venture to present this monograph in the hope of kindling the interest of some graduate students in the study of this-probably the most spectacular and often the most beautiful of solar activity manifestation. However, since it is the physical processes behind these events that will particu­ larly interest us, I also hope the book may be of help to some of my colleagues. In a rapidly developing field of science it is difficult, if not impossible, to present an overview that is up to date in every respect.

	abstract = {The complexity of prominence formation and structure is intimately related to energy balance. Fundamental properties of these structures are still being investigated and understanding the processes involved with heating and cooling of prominence material, which is partially ionized, is a critical piece of the puzzle. It is important to understand the nature of the chromosphere–corona transition region (CCTR) and, more specifically, the interplay among mechanical heating, radiative cooling, radiative heating, and thermal conduction that determines the location and structure of this transition region. For prominences to exist they need mechanical equilibrium (which is described by the equations of magneto-hydrostatics) and detailed energy balance, in which steady radiative cooling is balanced by heating mechanisms. Aspects of mechanical and energy balance have been thoroughly studied in the past, but models have difficulty accounting for both of these equilibria self-consistently on scales ranging from the central cool parts of the prominence into the corona.},

	abstract = {We discuss the origins and characteristics of solar eruptive phenomena focusing on coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their associated phenomena, particularly erupting prominences (EPs). Statistically, CMEs are most frequently associated with EPs and X-ray long-duration events. In a few large events the masses of the EP and CME have been separately measured, with the EP mass comprising a large fraction of the total CME mass. EP and CME near-surface precursors include the development of sigmoids, the darkening and broadening of filaments, and their slow rise and Doppler shifts, and the cancellation of magnetic flux near filament channels. Prominences exist within coronal cavities which themselves are embedded in helmet streamers extending to high heights. This entire structure can erupt bodily to become a CME; indeed the most massive and energetic CMEs appear to be of this type. CMEs carry into the heliosphere large quantities of coronal magnetic fields and plasma which are detected by remote sensing and measured in-situ at spacecraft. The most important in-situ CME signature is a magnetic cloud, considered to be the flux rope embedded in most if not all CMEs. Although most CMEs are frequently associated with EPs near the Sun, it is still not known why the prominence material is only rarely identified in-situ. In the last decade, however, we have had heliospheric imaging observations that are helping to distinguish prominence material from the rest of a CME.},

Following an idea of a solar-stellar analogy, CME phenomena are expected on other stars as well. The main planetary impact factors of the stellar CMEs include the associated interplanetary shocks, plasma density and velocity disturbances, energetic particles accelerated in the shock regions, as well as distortions of the magnetic field direction and modulus. All these factors should be properly taken into account during the study of evolutionary processes on exoplanets and their atmospheric and plasma environments. The planetary impact of the stellar CME activity may vary depending on stellar age, stellar spectral type and the orbital distance of a planet. Because of the relatively short range of propagation of the majority of CMEs, they affect most strongly the magnetospheres and atmospheres of close-orbit ( {\textless} 0.1 AU) exoplanets. In this chapter we discuss an issue of the stellar CME activity in the context of several actual problems of modern exoplanetology, including planetary atmosphere mass loss, planet survival at close orbits, and definition of a criterion for habitability.},

In the most extreme cases, CMEs and prominences may have a global effect on man-made technologies and human beings, especially if they are in space. The conditions in the near-Earth environment directly affected by the Sun and the solar activity are known as space weather and will be discussed here.In this chapter, we review different types of measurements and observations of prominences and CMEs as they propagate between the Sun and the Earth, as well as recent advances in numerical modeling and theoretical ideas related to CME propagation. We also discuss the potential effects of CMEs and prominences on Earth’s magnetosphere and atmosphere and the very direct impact it may exert on our lives.},

	abstract = {Solar prominences are bright cloud-like structures when observed beyond the solar limb and they appear as dark filamentary objects which are termed filaments when seen against the solar disk. The aims of prominence classifications were from the start to establish references and frameworks for understanding the physical conditions for their formation and development through interplay with the solar magnetic environment. The multi-thermal nature of solar prominences became fully apparent once observations from space in UV, VUV, EUV and X-rays could be made. The cool prominence plasma is thermally shielded from the much hotter corona and supported in the field of gravity by small- and large-scale magnetic fields of the filament channels. High cadence, subarcsecond observing facilities on ground and in space have firmly proven the highly dynamic nature of solar prominences down to the smallest observed structural sizes of 100 km. The origin of the ubiquitous oscillations and flowing of the plasma over a variety of spatial and temporal scales, whether the cool dense plasma originates from below via levitation, injections by reconnection or results from condensation processes, are central issues in prominence research today. The unveiling of instabilities leading to prominences eruptions and Coronal Mass Ejections is another important challenge. The objective of this chapter is to review the main characteristics of various types of prominences and their associated magnetic environments, which will all be addressed in details in the following chapters of this book.},

The solar-cycle variation of eruptive prominence locations is discussed with a particular emphasis on the rush-to-the-pole (RTTP) phenomenon. One of the consequences of the RTTP phenomenon is polar CMEs, which are shown to be similar to the low-latitude CMEs. This similarity is important because it provides important clues to the mechanism by which CMEs erupt. The nonradial motion of CMEs is discussed, including the deflection by coronal holes that have important space weather consequences.

Using the He D3 line as example we describe and illustrate the computation of the polarization emitted by He atoms in the presence of magnetic fields. The relatively weak magnetic fields expected in prominences require taking into consideration a long series of quantum coherences between the atomic levels of the He atom, coherences that are critical for the sensitivity of the emitted radiation and its polarization to the magnetic fields. But solving that quantum problem is only half the task: the observed polarized profiles need to be compared to the computed ones until a match is found. This inference or inversion can only work when the appropriate numerical technicals are put to work, techniques that help identify what magnetic field is the best solution for an observed profile, that can make use of all the available observables while being robust in front of noise and the low brightness of prominences and filaments respect to the entouring photosphere. These difficulties can be tackled but at the prixe of some approximations that have to be kept in mind in the analysis of prominence magnetic fields at the risk of serious mistakes on the inferred magnetic fields.

Since mid-1996, however, the SOHO Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instruments have observed many halo or partial-halo CMEs. A halo CME, especially when associated with solar activity near sun center, is important for space weather concerns because it suggests the launch of a potentially geoeffective disturbance toward Earth. During the post-solar minimum period from December 1996 to June 1997, we found that all six halo CMEs that were likely Earthward-directed were associated with shocks, magnetic clouds, and moderate geomagnetic storms at Earth 3–5 days later. The results imply that magnetic cloud-like structures are a general characteristic of CMEs. Most of the storms were driven by strong, sustained southward fields either in the magnetic clouds, in the post-shock region, or both. We discuss the characteristics of the halo events observed during this period, their associated signatures near the solar surface, and their usefulness as predictors of space weather at Earth.},

The basic outlook and approach remain the same: To develop the subject of probability theory and stochastic processes as a deductive discipline and to illustrate the theory with basic applications of engineering interest. To this extent. these remarks made in the first edition are still valid: "The book is written neither for the handbook-oriented students nor for the sophisticated few (if any) who can learn the subject from advanced mathematical texts. It is written for the majority of engineers and physicists who have sufficient maturity to appreciate and follow a logical presentation.... There is an obvious lack of continuity between the elements of probability as presented in introductory courses, and the sophisticated concepts needed in today's applications.... Random variables. transformations, expected values, conditional densities, characteristic functions cannot be mastered with mere exposure. These concepts must be clearly defined and must be developed, one at a time, with sufficient elaboration."},

Nevertheless, it has been widely demonstrated that only combination of multi-wavelength data (including X-ray spectra, EUV images, EUV-UV spectra, and radio dynamic spectra) can provide complete information on the plasma temperature and density distributions, non-thermal motions, magnetic fields, and other physical parameters, for both CMEs and CME-related phenomena. In this work, we analyze three CMEs by combining simultaneous data acquired in the polarized visible light by the LASCO-C2 coronagraph and in the UV H i Lyα line (1216 Å) by the UVCS spectrometer, in order to estimate the CME plasma electron density (using the polarization-ratio technique to infer the 3D structure of the CME) and temperature (from the comparison between the expected and measured Lyα intensities) along the UVCS field of view. This analysis is primarily aimed at testing the diagnostic methods that will be applied to coronagraphic observations of CMEs delivered by the Metis instrument on board the next ESA-Solar Orbiter mission. We find that CME cores are usually associated with cooler plasma (\$T{\textbackslash}sim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$ K), and that a significant increase of the electron temperatures is observed from the core to the front of the CME (where \$T{\textbackslash}gt \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{6.3\}\$ K), which seems to be correlated, in all cases, with the morphological structure of the CME as derived from visible-light images.},

We test our forward modeling technique on 34 LASCO CMEs analyzed by Cremades \& Bothmer. We are able to reproduce the CME morphology and derive the electron density (at the CME front) of these events using multi-instrument observations (MDI, Hα, EIT, LASCO) under the assumption of self-similar expansion. This study suggests that a flux rope-like structure is a good description for these events. We also find that we need to invoke a deflection and/or rotation of the structure relative to the position and orientation of the source region in most cases. Finally, we demonstrate an original technique to fit the electron density of the CME leading edge. We find that, on average, the peak of the density at the CME front is 7.5 times that in the equatorial model of Saito et al., and can reach {\textasciitilde}22 times the model in some cases.},

These studies focused more on the results rather than the details of the model itself. As more researchers begin to use the model, it becomes necessary to provide a deeper discussion on how it is derived, which is the purpose of this paper. The model is built using the following features and constraints: (1) the legs are conical, (2) the front is pseudo-circular, (3) the cross section is circular, and (4) it expands in a self-similar way. We derive the equation of the model from these constraints. We also show that the ice-cream cone model is a limit of the GCS when the two legs overlap completely. Finally, we provide formulae for the calculation of various geometrical dimensions, such as angular width and aspect ratio, as well as the pseudo-code that is used for its computer implementation.},

	abstract = {Solar filaments exhibit a range of eruptive-like dynamic activity from the full, or partial, eruption of the filament mass and surrounding magnetic structure, as a CME, to a fully confined dynamic evolution or “failed” eruption, sometimes producing a flare but no CME. Additionally, observations of erupting filaments often show a clear helical structure, indicating the presence of a magnetic flux rope. Dynamic helical structures, in addition to being twisted, frequently show evidence of being kinked, with the axis of the flux rope exhibiting a large-scale writhe. Motivated by the fact that kinking motions are also detected in filaments that fail to erupt, we investigate the possible relationship between the kinking of a filament and its success or failure to erupt. We present an analysis of kinking in filaments and its implications for other filament phenomena such as the nature of the eruption, eruptive acceleration, and post-eruptive re-formation. We elucidate the relationship between kinking and the various filament phenomena via a simple physical picture of the forces involved in kinking together with specific definitions of the types of filament eruption. The present study offers results directly applicable to observations, allowing a thorough exploration of the implications of the observational relationship between kinking and filament phenomena and provides new insight for modelers of CME initiation.},

The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security. We propose a possible solution to these challenges: secure federated learning. Beyond the federated-learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated-learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.},

	abstract = {Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches.  We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning.  We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

JAMES BEARD AWARD WINNER - WINNER OF THE TALES OF THE COCKTAIL SPIRITED AWARD(R) FOR BEST NEW COCKTAIL OR BARTENDING BOOK - NAMED ONE OF THE BEST COOKBOOKS OF THE YEAR BY CHICAGO TRIBUNE  "There are only six cocktails." So say Alex Day, Nick Fauchald, and David Kaplan, the visionaries behind the seminal craft cocktail bar Death \& Co. In Cocktail Codex, these experts reveal for the first time their surprisingly simple approach to mastering cocktails: the "root recipes," six easily identifiable (and memorizable!) templates that encompass all cocktails: the old-fashioned, martini, daiquiri, sidecar, whisky highball, and flip. Once you understand the hows and whys of each "family," you'll understand why some cocktails work and others don't, when to shake and when to stir, what you can omit and what you can substitute when you're missing ingredients, why you like the drinks you do, and what sorts of drinks you should turn to--or invent--if you want to try something new.  Praise for Cocktail Codex   "Learn the template, and any cocktail you can think of is within reach."--Food \& Wine  "Too bad all college textbooks weren't this much fun."--Garden \& Gun  "A must for amateur and pro mixologists alike."--Chicago Tribune  "If Dora the Explorer turned twenty-one, split herself into three people, and decided to write the Magna Carta of booze books, this would be the result. And, unlike every other book you'll read this year, Cocktail Codex is packed with actual knowledge you can use in the real world. Please, please, can Cinema Codex be next?"--Steven Soderbergh, filmmaker},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation --- collaborative filtering --- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering --- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and ‘snowflake’ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained ‘droplets’ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic markedly changed human mobility patterns, necessitating epidemiological models that can capture the effects of these changes in mobility on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Here we introduce a metapopulation susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ten of the largest US metropolitan areas. Our mobility networks are derived from mobile phone data and map the hourly movements of 98 million people from neighbourhoods (or census block groups) to points of interest such as restaurants and religious establishments, connecting 56,945 census block groups to 552,758 points of interest with 5.4 billion hourly edges. We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in the behaviour of the population over time. Our model predicts that a small minority of ‘superspreader’ points of interest account for a large majority of the infections, and that restricting the maximum occupancy at each point of interest is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our model also correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups2–8 solely as the result of differences in mobility: we find that disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce their mobility as sharply, and that the points of interest that they visit are more crowded and are therefore associated with higher risk. By capturing who is infected at which locations, our model supports detailed analyses that can inform more-effective and equitable policy responses to COVID-19.},

The distributed nature of these problems calls for methods that are, themselves, distributed. While most collaborative learning problems require agents to reach a common (or consensus) model, there are situations in which the consensus solution may not be optimal. For instance, agents may want to reach a compromise between agreeing with their neighbors and minimizing a personal loss function. We present DJAM, a Jacobi-like distributed algorithm for learning personalized models. This method is implementation-friendly: it has no hyperparameters that need tuning, it is asynchronous, and its updates only require single-neighbor interactions. We prove that DJAM converges with probability one to the solution, provided that the personal loss functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz gradient. We then give evidence that DJAM is on par with state-of-the-art methods: our method reaches a solution with error similar to the error of a carefully tuned alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in about the same number of single-neighbor interactions.},

	abstract = {In women with vaginal hypoplasia, such as in Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome (MRKH) and in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS), surgical vaginoplasty and non-surgical self-dilation treatments are available to lengthen the vagina and facilitate sexual intercourse, but the best treatment remains controversial. Vaginal dilation has been recommended as a first-line treatment, because of its less invasive character and high success rate. However, the exploration of factors associated with compliance and long-term outcome is incomplete, including whether psychological counselling needs to be embedded in treatment to maximize efficacy. It is not known if failed vaginal dilation therapy jeopardizes further surgical success outcomes, especially because in a number of these procedures ongoing vaginal dilation is required. In addition, if surgery is needed, there is a lack of evidence to inform physicians regarding the optimum surgical technique to use. Also, it is unclear whether maintenance dilation therapy in case of sexual inactivity is crucial to ensure functional success.In view of this ongoing debate, we performed a search of all published literature (English language only) restricted to the management of vaginal hypoplasia in patients with MRKH or CAIS from 1898 to March 2013 using Pubmed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Of the 6700 articles initially identified, a total of 190 studies are analysed. More specifically, by establishing the risk/efficacy profile (vaginal capacity, complications and long-term durability in terms of sexual function) of the different surgical and non-surgical reconstruction techniques, we evaluate if vaginal dilation proposed as the first-line technique is justified based on the evidence.When anatomical success was defined as a length of ≥7 cm and functional success as coitus, all vaginoplasty techniques yielded significantly higher success rates (\&gt;90 versus 75\% after vaginal dilation), irrespective of underlying diagnosis or start vaginal length. When functional success was defined as ‘satisfaction with sex’, including non-genital sex, differences disappeared. Failed dilation therapy does not preclude anatomical (nor functional) success if vaginoplasty afterwards is necessary. Traction vaginoplasty seems to have the highest anatomical (99\%) and functional success rates (96\%), whereas both split- and full-thickness skin graft procedures and intestinal procedures have the lowest successful outcomes (83–95\%). Overall, complication rates were significantly lower within the vaginal dilation groups when compared with the different vaginoplasty techniques. Although no randomized control data exist regarding maintenance dilation, the available evidence suggests that continued dilation is needed to maintain patency in periods of coital inactivity. Despite the expectancy that the probability of further positive outcomes is maximized with psychological counselling, this could not be confirmed.As the medical literature lacks high-quality comparative outcome studies and prospective, longitudinal studies are scarce, no evidence-based treatment guidelines can be provided. However, because of the physically low complication rate and an overall success chance of 75\%, vaginal dilation as first choice treatment seems to be justified. Overall, the laparoscopic Vecchietti procedure, becoming more and more available in specialized centres, is considered an appropriate surgical option in patients who are poorly compliant and failed dilation therapy, or for those who do not want to start with vaginal dilation therapy. Future approaches need to raise a wider range of psychosexually oriented questions, elucidate the relationship between vaginal depth and satisfactory outcomes and gain additional experience concerning the format of acceptable and efficient psychological care.},

With the increasing commoditization of computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation systems and the widespread deployment of learning-based back-end technologies such as digital advertising and intelligent infrastructures, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has moved from research labs to production. These changes have been made possible by unprecedented levels of data and computation, by methodological advances in machine learning, by innovations in systems software and architectures, and by the broad accessibility of these technologies. 
The next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments and increasingly impact our lives via frequent interactions and making (often mission-critical) decisions on our behalf, often in highly personalized contexts. Realizing this promise, however, raises daunting challenges. In particular, we need AI systems that make timely and safe decisions in unpredictable environments, that are robust against sophisticated adversaries, and that can process ever increasing amounts of data across organizations and individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of data these technologies can store and process. In this paper, we propose several open research directions in systems, architectures, and security that can address these challenges and help unlock AI's potential to improve lives and society.},

在《独裁者手册》这本书里，梅斯奎塔和史密斯研究多年，得出了一个能够相当完美地解释这一政治现象的理论，即：不管是国家、公司还是国际组织，其政治格局不能简单地以“民主”和“独裁”来划分，而必须用民意选民、实际选民、胜利联盟的数字多少来描写。如果胜利联盟的人数很多，那么这个国家就是我们通常所说的民主国家。反过来，如果胜利联盟的人数非常少，那么不管这个国家有没有选举，都是事实上的非民主国家。据此，很容易明白：在刚果，利奥波德二世只需要让少数人高兴就足以维持自己的统治；而在比利时，他必须让很多人满意才行。

不得不提，对任何想理解政治的真正运作方式的人来说，《独裁者手册》都是一本必读的书，无论是政治领域的政治还是商业界的政治，无论是在独裁国家还是在民主国家。},

	abstract = {On turning eighty, David Hockney sought out rustic tranquility for the first time: a place to watch the sunset and the change of the seasons; a place to keep the madness of the world at bay. So when Covid-19 and lockdown struck, it made little difference to life at La Grande Cour, the centuries-old Normandy farmhouse where Hockney set up a studio a year earlier, in time to paint the arrival of spring. In fact, he relished the enforced isolation as an opportunity for even greater devotion to his art.

Spring Cannot Be Cancelled is an uplifting manifesto that affirms art’s capacity to divert and inspire. It is based on a wealth of new conversations and correspondence between Hockney and art critic Martin Gayford, his long-time friend and collaborator. Their exchanges are illustrated by a selection of Hockney’s new Normandy drawings and paintings alongside works by Van Gogh, Monet, Bruegel, and others.

We see how Hockney is propelled ever forward by his infectious enthusiasms and sense of wonder. A lifelong contrarian, he has been in the public eye for sixty years, yet remains entirely unconcerned by the view of critics or even history. He is utterly absorbed by his four acres of northern France and by the themes that have fascinated him for decades: light, color, space, perception, water, trees. He has much to teach us, not only about how to see . . . but about how to live.},

While optical telescopes may have presented a peek into the structure of the constituents of the universe, such as stars and galaxies, new windows of observation have revealed far more amorphous objects, from nebulae and sheets to filaments and voids, whose "violent" processes include flares, shocks, accretion disks and jets. In these processes, plasma is often the constituent matter-- as well as the medium through which the astrophysical setting becomes so violent. In this graduate level text, Tajima and Shibata offer a new synthesis starting where classic works on plasma physics left off. Beginning with a view of plasma astrophysics through fundamental processes of quasi-magnetostatic equilibria, quasi-hydrostatic equilibria, and non-equilibria, the authors go on to develop unique approaches to violent astrophysical plasmas-- as opposed to the more quiescent laboratory variety-- and their processes. The text continues with an exploration of the fundamental processes in hydrostatic, magnetostatic, and gravitational objects. The final chapter is devoted to a discussion of the applications of plasma astrophysics to cosmology, anticipating future developments in this exciting field.This text will be of enormous use to graduate-- and some advanced undergraduate-- students, as well as to physicists entering the field of plasma physics.},

The natural way in which the author unifies observations and theory gives a wide perspective to the subject. An important feature is the lucidly written presentation of the fundamentals of plasma physics. The basic theory thus developed is then extended to some exemplary and important observations of coronal dynamics, such as coronal currents, particle acceleration, propagation of particle beams, and shocks. The book has grown from teaching introductory courses on plasma astrophysics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH). It addresses advanced undergraduates and first-year graduate students without a background in plasma physics. It will also be of interest to more senior research workers involved in coronal physics of the Sun and other stars, solar/stellar winds, and various other fields of plasma astrophysics.},

To mitigate these overheads, several studies propose the use of sparsified stochastic gradients. We argue that these are facets of a general sparsification method that can operate on any possible atomic decomposition. Notable examples include element-wise, singular value, and Fourier decompositions. We present ATOMO, a general framework for atomic sparsification of stochastic gradients. Given a gradient, an atomic decomposition, and a sparsity budget, ATOMO gives a random unbiased sparsification of the atoms minimizing variance. We show that recent methods such as QSGD and TernGrad are special cases of ATOMO and that sparsifiying the singular value decomposition of neural networks gradients, rather than their coordinates, can lead to significantly faster distributed training.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has been proved to be an effective learning framework when data cannot be centralized due to privacy, communication costs, and regulatory restrictions. When training deep learning models under an FL setting, people employ the predefined model architecture discovered in the centralized environment. However, this predefined architecture may not be the optimal choice because it may not fit data with non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID). Thus, we advocate automating federated learning (AutoFL) to improve model accuracy and reduce the manual design effort. We specifically study AutoFL via Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which can automate the design process. We propose a Federated NAS (FedNAS) algorithm to help scattered workers collaboratively searching for a better architecture with higher accuracy. We also build a system based on FedNAS. Our experiments on non-IID dataset show that the architecture searched by FedNAS can outperform the manually predefined architecture.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is typically approached as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize a global loss function by distributing computation across client devices that possess local data and specify different parts of the global objective. We present an alternative perspective and formulate federated learning as a posterior inference problem, where the goal is to infer a global posterior distribution by having client devices each infer the posterior of their local data. While exact inference is often intractable, this perspective provides a principled way to search for global optima in federated settings. Further, starting with the analysis of federated quadratic objectives, we develop a computation- and communication-efficient approximate posterior inference algorithm -- federated posterior averaging (FedPA). Our algorithm uses MCMC for approximate inference of local posteriors on the clients and efficiently communicates their statistics to the server, where the latter uses them to refine a global estimate of the posterior mode. Finally, we show that FedPA generalizes federated averaging (FedAvg), can similarly benefit from adaptive optimizers, and yields state-of-the-art results on four realistic and challenging benchmarks, converging faster, to better optima.},

However, these algorithms do not apply to the decentralized learning setting, when a network of agents are working collaboratively to learn the parameters of a statistical model without sharing their individual data due to privacy reasons or communication constraints. We study two algorithms: Decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) and Decentralized SGHMC (DE-SGHMC) which are adaptations of SGLD and SGHMC methods that allow scaleable Bayesian inference in the decentralized setting for large datasets. We show that when the posterior distribution is strongly log-concave and smooth, the iterates of these algorithms converge linearly to a neighborhood of the target distribution in the 2-Wasserstein distance if their parameters are selected appropriately. We illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms on decentralized Bayesian linear regression and Bayesian logistic regression problems.},

Our analysis show that the initial KL-divergence between the Markov Chain and the target posterior distribution is exponentially decreasing while the error contributions to the overall KL-divergence from the additive noise is decreasing in polynomial time. We further show that the polynomial-term experiences speed-up with number of agents and provide sufficient conditions on the time-varying step-sizes to guarantee convergence to the desired distribution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a wide variety of machine learning tasks. The empirical results show that the performance of individual agents with locally available data is on par with the centralized setting with considerable improvement in the convergence rate.},

The radiation environment on the Moon includes primary space radiation and secondary radiation, which is induced in the lunar soil. Both primary and secondary radiation may pose severe health issues to future crews on the Moon. In this work, we build a detailed radiation environment model “Radiation Environment and Dose at the Moon (REDMoon)” for the lunar surface and subsurface. We use the GEANT4 (GEometry ANd Tracking) Monte-Carlo code and “response function” approach to calculate type-, energy-, angular-, depth-, and time-dependent particle spectra induced by galactic cosmic rays at the surface and subsurface of the Moon. Calculated radiation particle fluxes on and beneath the surface are in good agreement with previous experimental and numerical results while offering more details on the lunar radiation fields, such as angular and depth information. The depth profile of secondary particle spectra in the lunar soil has a maximum between 0.5 and 1 m below the surface, depending on particle type and energy. The angular distribution of secondary particles (in particular neutron, -rays, electrons) with energy 1 MeV is mostly isotropic, while higher energy particles preferentially propagate downward. Our model provides full coverage of the spatial, directional, and energy information of the radiation field at the surface and subsurface of the Moon, which can serve for designing future human bases on the Moon.},

We find two different wake structures for an interplanetary magnetic field that is perpendicular to the solar wind flow, and for one that is parallell to the flow. The wake for intermediate magnetic field directions will be a mix of these two extreme conditions. Several features are consistent with a fluid interaction, e.g., the presence of a rarefaction cone, and an increased magnetic field in the wake. There are however several kinetic features of the interaction. We find kinks in the magnetic field at the wake boundary. There are also density and magnetic field variations in the far wake, maybe from an ion beam instability related to the wake refill. The results are compared to observations by the WIND spacecraft during a wake crossing. The model magnetic field and ion velocities are in agreement with the measurements. The density and the electron temperature in the central wake are not as well captured by the model, probably from the lack of electron physics in the hybrid model.},

Deflections are also detected over weak ({\textless}3 nT at 30 km altitude) and small-scale ({\textless}100 km) magnetic anomalies, which might be explained by charge separation and the resulting electric potential. Strong deflection from a wide area implies that the magnetic anomalies act as a magnetosphere-like obstacle, affecting the upstream solar wind. It also reduces the implantation rate of the solar wind protons to the lunar surface, which may affect space weathering near the magnetic anomalies.},

	abstract = {Extensive magnetic field observations together with crucial plasma measurements by the Explorer 35 lunar orbiter and Apollo surface and orbital experiments have established the basic nature of the moon's interaction with the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field. The effective absorption of the incident solar wind by the moon creates a plasma void or cavity behind the moon. The cavity-associated magnetic signature is characterized by an enhancement in magnetic field magnitude B within the cavity as compared with the mean level of B in the surrounding interplanetary plasma and dips or decreases in B near the cavity boundaries with the solar wind. The axis of the lunar wake is aberrated from the moon-sun line by the relative velocity of the solar wind with respect to the moon, and the cross section of the wake is elliptical, reflecting the anisotropic propagation of magnetoacoustic waves in the solar wind. Enhancements in B are often observed just external, i.e., on the solar wind side, of the rarefaction-associated dips in the field magnitude. These are of perturbation magnitude at the altitude of Explorer 35, whereas at the low height of the subsatellites they are often large field increases or limb compressions that occur either just upstream of or directly above lunar limbs. Particular surface regions of the moon seem more effective than others as a source of the limb compressions; the pertinent regional property is likely to be remanent magnetization. Propagation of the limb disturbances downstream from the source and the efficacy with which a regional property can create a disturbance in the solar wind flow past the moon's limb depend on properties of the plasma and interplanetary magnetic field. The main enhancement of B in the shadow region behind the moon is a more conspicuous feature of the magnetosheath interaction, whereas the field strength dips and the limb compressions become more difficult to identify in the highly variable state of the magnetic field. In the lobes of the geomagnetic tail, remanent lunar magnetic fields are readily detected at the subsatellite altitude. There is a distinct structure associated with the average field magnitude measured by the Apollo 15 subsatellite in the plasma sheet of the geomagnetic tail; B is enhanced over the day side quadrant of the subsatellite orbit. This variation in the average magnitude of the magnetic field may be associated with the drift of plasma sheet particles toward the earth, creating a wake region centered approximately on the day side orbital quadrant of the subsatellite. Alternatively, flux tube depletion earthward of the moon may explain the observed day side enhancement of average magnetic field magnitude. Apollo particle and field measurements on the lunar surface have provided evidence of a regional interaction of the highly conducting solar wind with lunar remanent magnetic fields. Simultaneous Ogo 5, Vela 5, and Apollo 12 spectrometer data of ion density and velocity taken when the Ogo and Vela satellites were in the solar wind and the Apollo spectrometer was on the lunar day side also exposed to solar wind plasma show that the proton velocity is smaller and the proton density is larger at the Apollo site than in the free stream solar wind, a result of proton deceleration at the site by an electric field established via the plasma-remanent magnetic field interaction. Simultaneous plasma and magnetic field data, from the spectrometer and the lunar surface magnetometer at the Apollo 12 location, show the compression of the local remanent field by large solar wind and magnetosheath plasma dynamic pressures.},

We present detailed analysis of the electrostatic waves observed on the outbound side of the flyby that were associated with electron beams. Halekas et al. (2011) derived a net potential across the lunar wake from observations and suggested that the net potential generated the observed electron beams and the electron beams in turn excited the observed electrostatic waves due to kinetic instabilities. The wavelengths and velocities of the electrostatic waves are estimated, using high-resolution electric field instrument data with cross-spectrum analysis and cross-correlation analysis. In general, the estimated wavelengths vary from a few hundred meters to a couple of thousand meters. The estimated phase velocities are on the order of 1000 km s−1. In addition, we perform 1-D Vlasov simulations to help identify the mode of the observed electrostatic waves. We conclude that the observed electrostatic waves are likely on the electron beam mode branch.},

We propose to train personalized models that leverage a collaboration graph describing the relationships between user personal tasks, which we learn jointly with the models. Our fully decentralized optimization procedure alternates between training nonlinear models given the graph in a greedy boosting manner, and updating the collaboration graph (with controlled sparsity) given the models. Throughout the process, users exchange messages only with a small number of peers (their direct neighbors when updating the models, and a few random users when updating the graph), ensuring that the procedure naturally scales with the number of users. Overall, our approach is communication-efficient and avoids exchanging personal data. We provide an extensive analysis of the convergence rate, memory and communication complexity of our approach, and demonstrate its benefits compared to competing techniques on synthetic and real datasets.},

Our first approach, inspired from label propagation, aims to smooth pre-trained local models over the network while accounting for the confidence that each agent has in its initial model. In our second approach, agents jointly learn and propagate their model by making iterative updates based on both their local dataset and the behavior of their neighbors.

Based on a rigorous conservation-of-information principle, this novel method yields globally optimal or conservatively suboptimal filters with a variety of selectable operating characteristics. The method applies to decentralized systems in which one or more sensor-dedicated local filters feed a large master filter. The local filters operate in parallel, processing unique data from independent local sensors, and common data from a shared reference system. Data compression by the local filters further improves overall processing speed. The novel information-sharing technique allows the master filter to treat the local filter solutions as statistically independent, with no need to maintain local/local or local/master cross-correlation matrices. The method permits several modes of accumulated information sharing.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This paper focuses on the communication aspect of the network. A channel ﬁlter that handles general PDF’s is developed. The channel ﬁlter assures that complete global information is recovered at each node provided that the network connectivity is acyclic. A channel manager is also developed that uses the Hellinger divergence measure between the node and channel estimates adaptively determines when to communicate on any particular channel. It is proven to signiﬁcantly reduce the communication loads. Simulation results are used to evaluate the accuracy of the ﬁltering algorithm and demonstrate the efﬁciency of the resulting coordinated search trajectories.},

	abstract = {Gradient-based training in federated learning is known to be vulnerable to faulty/malicious worker nodes, which are often modeled as Byzantine clients. Previous work either makes use of auxiliary data at parameter server to verify the received gradients or leverages statistic-based methods to identify and remove malicious gradients from Byzantine clients. In this paper, we acknowledge that auxiliary data may not always be available in practice and focus on the statistic-based approach. However, recent work on model poisoning attacks have shown that well-crafted attacks can circumvent most of existing median- and distance-based statistical defense methods, making malicious gradients indistinguishable from honest ones. To tackle this challenge, we show that the element-wise sign of gradient vector can provide valuable insight in detecting model poisoning attacks. Based on our theoretical analysis of state-of-the-art attack, we propose a novel approach, {\textbackslash}textit\{SignGuard\}, to enable Byzantine-robust federated learning through collaborative malicious gradient filtering. More precisely, the received gradients are first processed to generate relevant magnitude, sign, and similarity statistics, which are then collaboratively utilized by multiple, parallel filters to eliminate malicious gradients before final aggregation. We further provide theoretical analysis of SignGuard by quantifying its convergence with appropriate choice of learning rate and under non-IID training data. Finally, extensive experiments of image and text classification tasks - including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and AG-News - are conducted together with recently proposed attacks and defense strategies. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.},

有两种方法可以让文化精神枯萎，一种是奥威尔式的——文化成为一个监狱，另一种是赫胥黎式的——文化成为一场滑稽戏。
——尼尔·波兹曼

《娱乐至死》初版于1985年，是尼尔·波兹曼的代表作之一。

电视时代蒸蒸日上，电视改变了公众话语的内容和意义，政治、宗教、教育、体育、商业和任何其他公共领域的内容，都日渐以娱乐的方式出现，并成为一种文化精神，而人类无声无息地成为娱乐的附庸，毫无怨言，甚至心甘 情愿，其结果是我们成了一个娱乐至死的物种。

乔治·奥威尔曾在《一九八四》中预言人类将会遭受外来压迫，失去自由；赫胥黎则在《美丽新世界》中表达了另一种忧虑：人们会渐渐爱上工业技术带来的娱乐和文化，不再思考。

《娱乐至死》想告大家可能成为现实的，是赫胥黎的预言，不是奥威尔的预言；毁掉我们的，不是我们憎恨的东西，恰恰是我们热爱的东西！

媒体及专家评论：

赫胥黎的《美丽新世界》和奥威尔的《一九八四》在书中的交互作用俯拾即是。《娱乐至死》是一本优秀的、令人不安的、引发思考的书，而且我敢说，它是一本必读书。它配得上经典的地位，尽管过了20年，但它比任何书都贴近时下。
——蒂姆•查理斯（Tim Challies，Discerningreader.com）

《娱乐至死》在帮助我们看清（电视）屏幕里到底在发生些什么，在这一点上，它是最优秀的。那种画面，即便没有“文化灭亡”的末日预言，也足够阴郁了。
——沃尔特·古德曼（Walter Goodman，《纽约时报》）

娱乐时代的当头一棒，尼尔·波兹曼的深刻预见。

我们今天已经处在波兹曼描述的世界里，处在一个信息和行动比严重失调的时代，在空前便利的电子传媒时代，我们比任何时候都聪明，也比任何时候都轻飘。《娱乐至死》的预言指向了我们今天的现实。

——陈丹青

波兹曼在媒体研究领域是一位巨人，地位仅次于马歇尔·麦克卢汉。

——安吉拉·佩妮，《抨击杂志》

波兹曼极具说服力地调动了心理学、历史学、语义学、麦克卢汉理论以及常识，阐述了一个触目惊心且颇具独创性的论题。

——维克托·纳瓦斯基，哥伦比亚大学教授

波兹曼在麦克卢汉结束的地方开始，他用学者的渊博与说书人的机智构筑他的见解。

——《基督教科学箴言报》

尼尔·波兹曼的逝世给公共话语带来了某些寂静。一位博学的批评者，一位严谨的反对者，一位跟奔涌的发展唱反调的人，沉默了。回顾他令人惊叹的事业，你会发现他所做的每一件事的核心都是一连串问题……他希望你去思考，字母表是如何改变了口语文化的，印刷媒体给宗教造成了什么样的影响，教育是如何创造了童年的，为何对标准的测试意味着对学校系统的激进反思。
——彼得·卡瓦纳，《环球邮报》

作家、媒体批评家尼尔 ·波兹曼的去世并未得到应有的（新闻媒体的）重视。但这一点也没有让波兹曼吃惊。我们时代媒体批评领域最伟大的书之一《娱乐至死》是他写的……波兹曼比任何人都了解，电视无可挽回地改变了辩论的本质，娱乐如今在政界占至高地位。
——吉姆·本宁，alternet.org

尼尔·波兹曼是一位传承伟大纽约传统的不可思议的讲述者……正如他说的故事一样，尼尔·波兹曼投入了一生来让我们停下来……他是一个和蔼谦恭的人，他绝对不会说，“我早就告诉过你了”。但是他的确告诉过我们，一次又一次地，直至肺癌让他永远消声。
——约翰·齐默尔曼，《纽约邮报》

我时常想起萧伯纳著名的诗句，理智的人适应环境，而世上所有的进步都依靠不理智的人。马歇尔·麦克卢汉是不理智的，兰斯是不理智的，尼尔也是不理智的。因为这样，所有美好的事才发生了。
——保罗·莱文森，美国作家、福特汉姆大学教授

波兹曼是一个多产的作家，他在约二十本书和众多的采访和文章中展现了他的思想和他的优雅。这些作品都值得阅读和深入思考，有意或无意间你会将你读到的说给他人听。波兹曼是看穿了皇帝新衣的孩子，后来他长成了擅长表达的义愤填膺的教育者和社会消费者。
——迈克尔·寇姆夫，《学院季刊》

波兹曼的每本书都是一本小册子，一本装了封皮的随笔：《童年的消逝》讽刺美国文化的幼稚化；《娱乐至死》讽刺娱乐业，以及娱乐业对观众造成的影响……他的知识分子姿态，他在公众环境中的表现，以及他伟大的天赋——极好的幽默，实质是一个开化人类在一个野蛮世纪进行的尝试，之后成了一个开化人在电视文化中的尝试。
——杰伊·罗森，纽约大学教授

在波兹曼的书中，隐喻的作用一次又一次地得到体现。我们设立“尼尔 ·波兹曼隐喻奖”有两个目的：奖励一位纯熟使用隐喻的有天分的作者；纪念并推广波兹曼的作品，以及印刷思想。
——锐透基金会

一本有才华、有力量、有分量的书。这是波兹曼抛出的严厉的控诉书，就我看来，他让人无法反驳。
——乔纳森·亚德利， 《华盛顿邮报》

有些书是每个人都应该读而事实上很少有人去读的。尼尔·波兹曼的《娱乐至死》就是其中之一。他对于娱乐时代对公共话语质量的毁灭性作用的分析提供了非同寻常的锐利洞见，这种洞见深入了到技术塑形思想与文化的方式，以及随之而来的社会各方各面的琐碎化。
——“潮起潮落”

出版于 1985年的《娱乐至死》是一本令人振奋的充满争议的书，它审视了电视对我们生活——更具体地说，是政治、文化和精神生活的——害处……本书有太多值得推荐的地方。它引发了许多思考，更让我们看到，电视是如何以某些方式侵蚀我们的公共话语甚至我们关于美好生活的整体概念的。
——谢默斯·斯威尼，social affairs unit.org

它是声讨电视文化的檄文：难道我们要把自己娱乐死？这一声喝问绝非危言耸听，我深信它是我们必须认真听取的警告。
——周国平

也许，文化拯救的希望就在于人类不断的自我反省之中，在于认真聆听波兹曼式的警世危言之中。
——刘擎

《娱乐至死》提出了一个很重要的观点，就是一个国家是在什么样的媒体占据主导地位的时代进入现代化的，这对整个社会的影响是很大的。

Originally published in 1985, Neil Postman’s groundbreaking polemic about the corrosive effects of television on our politics and public discourse has been hailed as a twenty-first-century book published in the twentieth century. Now, with television joined by more sophisticated electronic media—from the Internet to cell phones to DVDs—it has taken on even greater significance. Amusing Ourselves to Death is a prophetic look at what happens when politics, journalism, education, and even religion become subject to the demands of  entertainment. It is also a blueprint for regaining control of our media, so that they can serve our highest goals.

Previous studies have progressed from modeling chorus as a single wave to considering effects such as amplitude modulation or phase decoherence in wave particle resonance. However, incorporating realistic features of chorus waves in test particle calculations has always been a challenging but critically important step to evaluate their nonlinear effects. In this work, we use a rising-tone chorus element generated by a particle-in-cell simulation in test-particle simulations. The used chorus wave naturally has features including amplitude modulation, phase decoherence and dynamic evolution during propagation. Our results suggest that, while being latitudinal dependent, realistic features of chorus generally lead to significant suppression of nonlinear effects. This result should be important to understand phase space transport of electrons due to interactions with chorus waves.},

However, FL is difficult to implement realistically, both in terms of scale and systems heterogeneity. Although there are a number of research frameworks available to simulate FL algorithms, they do not support the study of scalable FL workloads on heterogeneous edge devices. In this paper, we present Flower -- a comprehensive FL framework that distinguishes itself from existing platforms by offering new facilities to execute large-scale FL experiments and consider richly heterogeneous FL device scenarios. Our experiments show Flower can perform FL experiments up to 15M in client size using only a pair of high-end GPUs. Researchers can then seamlessly migrate experiments to real devices to examine other parts of the design space.

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a new breed of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that builds upon decentralized data and training that brings learning to the edge or directly on-device. FL is a new research area often referred to as a new dawn in AI, is in its infancy, and has not yet gained much trust in the community, mainly because of its (unknown) security and privacy implications. To advance the state of the research in this area and to realize extensive utilization of the FL approach and its mass adoption, its security and privacy concerns must be first identified, evaluated, and documented. FL is preferred in use-cases where security and privacy are the key concerns and having a clear view and understanding of risk factors enable an implementer/adopter of FL to successfully build a secure environment and gives researchers a clear vision on possible research areas. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study concerning FL’s security and privacy aspects that can help bridge the gap between the current state of federated AI and a future in which mass adoption is possible. We present an illustrative description of approaches and various implementation styles with an examination of the current challenges in FL and establish a detailed review of security and privacy concerns that need to be considered in a thorough and clear context. Findings from our study suggest that overall there are fewer privacy-specific threats associated with FL compared to security threats. The most specific security threats currently are communication bottlenecks, poisoning, and backdoor attacks while inference-based attacks are the most critical to the privacy of FL. We conclude the paper with much needed future research directions to make FL adaptable in realistic scenarios.},

2008年出版的“经济学人”《讣告》，精心选择其中201篇广受欢迎的讣告，从戴安娜王妃到教宗约翰·保罗二世，从导演黑泽明到作家索尔·贝娄，从非洲大独裁者到花园里的跳蚤专家。有名人，也有被遗忘的人，有大师、圣徒，也有骗子和追名逐利者，甚至还有一只非洲灰鹦鹉，因为作者相信，“每个生命里都有值得倾听的故事”。

◆ 当代散文写作范本 ◆

《经济学人》讣告栏设立之初，是为给报纸增加“历史感和人文性”，除约一千个单词的长度外无任何限制。对戴安娜王妃这样所有讣告栏都会出现的名人，它的写作如何脱颖而出？对其他讣告栏无视的小人物，它的写作又如何能打动人？

用一千个单词抓住人物生命的核心，饱含温情，富有深度，风格隽永。《经济学人》讣告一直是同类写作中的翘楚，也堪称当代散文写作范本，每一篇都值得反复诵读与模仿。

◆ 五光十色的二十世纪缩影 ◆

《讣告》遴选人物时看重他们是否“活过有趣的一生”。这些人物多逝于二十世纪至二十一世纪初，多活跃于令人眩目的二十世纪的大部分。

他们的身份、行业、人生经历异乎寻常的丰富、各异，每一个人物，都是通向特定地域、领域、事件或行业的任意门。

通过一个从未听说的政客的一生，洞悉加勒比海小岛国在国际政治中的微妙角色；通过一个极端微生物学家，管窥死寂岩石上的生命科研世界。二百块拼图，拼出五光十色的另类二十世纪史。

◆ 小说般的娱乐性和文学性◆

讣告栏的读者们会乐此不疲地提到阅读讣告给他们带来的乐趣。除了名人不为人知的生活，烹饪老师和间谍、音乐通灵者、黑帮头子、爱国骗子、小报新闻大亨，这些奇特的人生故事具有极强的娱乐性。这是给传记、历史、猎奇和流行文化爱好者的绝佳礼物。“我从未杀过一个人，但我却很愉快地读了很多讣告。”（语出美国著名刑法律师克拉伦斯·达罗）

为何我们会喜爱读讣告？如同小说一样，讣告照亮细节，并报以深刻的同情。两位作者用他们独特的写作才华，为每一个生命故事赋予独特的风格，一声叹息之外，更多是对生命的礼赞，对人性的庆贺。

◆ 媒体评论 ◆

★（经济学人）讣告机智又毒舌，毒舌这个含义模糊的词在他们这里体现出最好的一面。但他们绝不残忍，而且总是一语中的。读者饱受这炼狱的折磨，却不得不承认这一点。

——《观察家》杂志

★没有哪一辆灵车比“经济学人”讣告更能优雅地送走人生的最后一程。每一篇都是一个小小的文学奇迹，穿越时空的奇妙旅程。选中的人物很幸运（除了死亡这部分），他们是带着无与伦比的风格走向另一世界的。

It is hard enough to find these qualities in trained photographers with the benefit of schooling and mentors and a community of fellow artists and aficionados supporting and rewarding their efforts. It is incredibly rare to find it in someone with no formal training and no network of peers. Yet Vivian Maier is all of these things, a professional nanny, who from the 1950s until the 1990s took over 100,000 photographs worldwide--from France to New York City to Chicago and dozens of other countries--and yet showed the results to no one. The photos are amazing both for the breadth of the work and for the high quality of the humorous, moving, beautiful, and raw images of all facets of city life in America's post-war golden age. It wasn't until local historian John Maloof purchased a box of Maier's negatives from a Chicago auction house and began collecting and championing her marvelous work just a few years ago that any of it saw the light of day.

The scheme can reach a linear speedup with respect to the number of workers, but this is rarely seen in practice as the scheme often suffers from large network delays and bandwidth limits. To overcome this communication bottleneck recent works propose to reduce the communication frequency. An algorithm of this type is local SGD that runs SGD independently in parallel on different workers and averages the sequences only once in a while. This scheme shows promising results in practice, but eluded thorough theoretical analysis. We prove concise convergence rates for local SGD on convex problems and show that it converges at the same rate as mini-batch SGD in terms of number of evaluated gradients, that is, the scheme achieves linear speedup in the number of workers and mini-batch size. The number of communication rounds can be reduced up to a factor of T{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}---where T denotes the number of total steps---compared to mini-batch SGD. This also holds for asynchronous implementations. Local SGD can also be used for large scale training of deep learning models. The results shown here aim serving as a guideline to further explore the theoretical and practical aspects of local SGD in these applications.},

Unlike previous works, we make no probabilistic assumptions on the data. We first show that for d dimensional data with n clients, a naive stochastic rounding approach yields a mean squared error (MSE) of Θ (d/n) and uses a constant number of bits per dimension per client. We then extend this naive algorithm in two ways: we show that applying a structured random rotation before quantization reduces the error to O((log d)/n) and a better coding strategy further reduces the error to O(1/n). We also show that the latter coding strategy is optimal up to a constant in the minimax sense i.e., it achieves the best MSE for a given communication cost. We finally demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by applying them to distributed Lloyd's algorithm for k-means and power iteration for PCA.},

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

	abstract = {In Federated Learning, we aim to train models across multiple computing units (users), while users can only communicate with a common central server, without exchanging their data samples. This mechanism exploits the computational power of all users and allows users to obtain a richer model as their models are trained over a larger set of data points. However, this scheme only develops a common output for all the users, and, therefore, it does not adapt the model to each user. This is an important missing feature, especially given the heterogeneity of the underlying data distribution for various users. In this paper, we study a personalized variant of the federated learning in which our goal is to find an initial shared model that current or new users can easily adapt to their local dataset by performing one or a few steps of gradient descent with respect to their own data. This approach keeps all the benefits of the federated learning architecture, and, by structure, leads to a more personalized model for each user. We show this problem can be studied within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework. Inspired by this connection, we study a personalized variant of the well-known Federated Averaging algorithm and evaluate its performance in terms of gradient norm for non-convex loss functions. Further, we characterize how this performance is affected by the closeness of underlying distributions of user data, measured in terms of distribution distances such as Total Variation and 1-Wasserstein metric.},

	abstract = {Ensuring ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for 5G wireless networks and beyond is of capital importance and is currently receiving tremendous attention in academia and industry. At its core, URLLC mandates a departure from expected utility-based network design approaches, in which relying on average quantities (e.g., average throughput, average delay, and average response time) is no longer an option but a necessity. Instead, a principled and scalable framework which takes into account delay, reliability, packet size, network architecture and topology (across access, edge, and core), and decision-making under uncertainty is sorely lacking. The overarching goal of this paper is a first step to filling this void. Towards this vision, after providing definitions of latency and reliability, we closely examine various enablers of URLLC and their inherent tradeoffs. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a wide variety of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the requirements of URLLC, as well as their applications through selected use cases. These results provide crisp insights for the design of low-latency and high-reliability wireless networks.},

A surprising consistent feature in the data returned is large-scale vortices that form exclusively on the dusk side of the magnetosphere. Here we present global kinetic hybrid simulations that explain these observations. It is shown that vortices are excited by a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability near the subsolar point, which grows convectively along the dusk-side magnetopause. Virtual time series along a track approximating a flyby of the MESSENGER show correspondence with the satellite data; the data contain sawtooth oscillations in plasma density, flow and magnetic field, and exhibit the observed dawn–dusk asymmetry. It is shown that asymmetry between dawn and dusk at Mercury is controlled by the finite gyroradius of ions and by convection electric fields. Mercury’s magnetosphere offers a natural laboratory for studying plasma regimes not present in other planetary magnetospheres or the laboratory.},

Such considerable occurrence rates of nonlinear interactions imply that the evolution of energetic electron fluxes should be dominated by nonlinear effects, rather than by quasi-linear diffusion as commonly assumed. We discuss the possible consequences of such a large amount of high-amplitude chorus waves and examine their characteristics that can influence the efficiency of nonlinear wave-particle interactions.},

In the absence of statistical information about plasma currents, theories of the magnetotail current sheets were mostly based on the isotropic stress balance. Such models suggest that thin current sheets cannot be long and should have strong plasma pressure gradients along the magnetotail. Using Magnetospheric Multiscale and THEMIS observations and global simulations, we explore realistic configuration of the magnetotail current sheet. We find that the magnetotail current sheet is thinner than expected from theories that assume isotropic stress balance. Observed plasma pressure gradients in thin current sheets are insufficiently strong (i.e., current sheets are too long) to balance the magnetic field line tension force. Therefore, pressure anisotropy is essential in the configuration of thin current sheets where instability precedes substorm onset.},

	abstract = {We study current carriers observed within thin current sheets ahead of and during the passage of earthward moving dipolarization fronts in the near-Earth plasma sheet using Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms (THEMIS) multipoint measurements. The fronts are embedded within flow bursts at the initial stage of bursty bulk flow events. Simultaneous north-south and radial separations between probes P3, P4, and P5 and the planar current sheet approximation enable estimation of cross-tail current density in the current sheet ahead of and within the fronts, respectively. The cross-tail current density increase ahead of the fronts, a substorm growth phase signature, is predominantly due to the ion diamagnetic current; at times, however, the electron pressure gradient may contribute up to 60\% of the total current density. Note that in this paper we refer to the horizontal (vertical) current sheet as the cross-tail current sheet (current sheet associated with dipolarization fronts). At the dipolarization fronts, the horizontal cross-tail current sheet (with a current density of several nA/m2) relaxes, and a vertical current sheet (with a current density of several tens of nA/m2), consistent with the thin interface of the front, appears. Thus, the cross-tail current at longitudes adjacent to the flow burst feeds into the dipolarization front's current sheet and may be extended to higher latitudes. The vertical current density also decreases after passage of the front. The pressure gradient of 1–10 keV electrons is a dominant contributor to the current in the dipolarization fronts. In the event studied, probes P1 and P2, which were several Earth radii downtail, reveal a tailward expansion of the current reduction process at a propagation velocity ∼50 km/s, even as the bulk flow carrying the magnetic flux remains earthward. This study shows how dipolarization fronts and their current systems are building blocks of the large-scale substorm current wedge.},

The conclusions drawn from the detailed analysis of a representative event are reinforced by a superposed epoch analysis applied on 2 years of data. The high-speed flows organize themselves in 10-min time scale flow enhancements which we call bursty bulk flow (BBF) events. Both temporal and spatial effects are responsible for their bursty nature. The flow velocity exhibits peaks of very large amplitude with a characteristic time scale of the order of a minute, which are usually associated with magnetic field dipolarizations and ion temperature increases. The BBFs represent intervals of enhanced earthward convection and energy transport per unit area in the y-z GSM direction of the order of 5×1019 ergs/RE².},

	abstract = {Space storms1 are the dominant contributor to space weather. During storms, rearrangement of the solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field lines at the dayside enhances global plasma circulation in the magnetosphere2,3. As this circulation proceeds, energy is dissipated into heat in the ionosphere and near-Earth space. As Earth’s dayside magnetic flux is eroded during this process, magnetotail reconnection must occur to replenish it. However, whether dissipation is powered by magnetotail (nightside) reconnection, as in storms’ weaker but more commonplace relatives, substorms4,5, or by enhanced global plasma circulation driven by dayside reconnection is unknown. Here we show that magnetotail reconnection near geosynchronous orbit powered an intense storm. Near-Earth reconnection at geocentric distances of {\textasciitilde}6.6–10 Earth radii—probably driven by the enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure and southward magnetic field—is observed from multi-satellite data. In this region, magnetic reconnection was expected to be suppressed by Earth’s strong dipole field. Revealing the physical processes that power storms and the solar wind conditions responsible for them opens a new window into our understanding of space storms. It encourages future exploration of the storm-time equatorial near-Earth magnetotail to refine storm driver models and accelerate progress towards space weather prediction.},

	abstract = {Data fuels and substantiates scientific discoveries. Advanced particle accelerator research is no different and has an inherent need for high-rate, high-resolution data. But in recent years, generating and handling the sheer amount data that is driving our discoveries became challenging. Just to name a few: scalable output from 3D simulations breaks down for modern supercomputers, high-rate Mpixel cameras generate GByte/s for laser control and comparing even just simulations to each other is a significant, manual, error-prone process. We present our open standard for particle and mesh based data, addressing these and more common challenges in our community. Based on state-of-the-art file formats and I/O libraries, we implement and improve scalable I/O without loosing self-description. openPMD is portable, truly self-describing, documented, forward-updatable and makes data comparable and reproducible. openPMD tries to follow best-practices towards an open-science workflow. While the meta standard is developed in an open, reviewable, versioned technical document, a large collection of tools and bindings develop around it. We will take a look at the community that fuels openPMD, the open-source projects evolving around it, adopters in the domain of astro-physics, photon-science and classical accelerator physics and the latest updates arriving in openPMD 2.0.0 .},

	abstract = {Whistler mode waves have been proposed as a crucial mechanism in determining the velocity-space distribution of electrons on the dayside crustal magnetic fields of Mars. A superthermal electron transport model has been unable to reproduce the observed pitch angle distributions on a crustal field line. The two key differences are that the observed pitch angle distributions are much more isotropic and the observed high energy pitch angle distributions have a flux peak at perpendicular pitch angles. We solve the bounce-averaged quasi-linear diffusion equation to calculate the steady-state pitch angle distribution of electrons along a crustal field line when in resonance with whistler mode waves. We perform two simulations, changing the background ionosphere, which affects what energies are in resonance with the whistler mode wave. The wave parameters are chosen based on previous observations of whistlers at Mars. Our results reconcile both qualitative differences between the previous data-model comparisons.},

Modeling the onset with particle codes requires either extremely large simulation boxes or open boundary conditions. In this Letter we report on simulations of reconnection in the magnetotail that incorporate open boundaries. In a simulation setup with the initial geometry similar to that of the GEM Reconnection Challenge bursts of spontaneous reconnection are detected in outflow regions that mimic magnetotails. They strongly resemble the ion tearing instability predicted by Schindler [1974] as a mechanism of magnetospheric substorms. Quenching the onset by replacing open boundary conditions for particles with their reintroduction reveals the key role of passing particles in the tearing destabilization.},

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical study on the properties of equatorial electron pitch angle distributions (PADs) in the Earth's outer radiation belt, for the first time based on particle measurements from the entire Van Allen Probes mission. A detailed selection criteria is used to identify intervals when flux measurements at energies from 0.2 to 3.4 MeV are available across a wide range of pitch angles close to the geomagnetic equatorial plane. To better characterize the shape of each pitch angle distribution, the flux data is fitted to functions of the equatorial pitch angle based on Legendre polynomials. Using this technique, we show that the shape of the PADs strongly depends on the particle's energy, location and geomagnetic activity. These results are used to identify the dominant physical processes responsible for creating PADs with different shapes. The results presented here mainly focus on the occurrence statistics and properties of butterfly PADs. Significantly, we find clear evidence that butterfly PADs have a peak flux that preferentially occurs at two distinct and discrete equatorial pitch angles, either 35° ± 5° or 65° ± 5°. Energy, L-shell and magnetic local time variations indicate that the flux peaks at equatorial pitch angles ∼35° appear consistent with magnetopause shadowing, whilst those peaking at ∼65° may be associated with wave-particle interactions. We also show that the flux at low and high pitch angles, for both butterfly and nonbutterfly PADs, remains remarkably well correlated even as the flux intensity varies by four orders of magnitude.},

These waves are propagating nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field, probably within less than 1° of perpendicular to it; they exist only between about twice the proton gyrofrequency and half the lower hybrid resonant frequency. The waves are confined to a region within about 2° of the equator and therefore have a large amplitude gradient along the magnetic field lines. They are resonant with harmonics of the electron bounce frequency and have sufficient amplitude (∼10 mγ rms) to cause the observed pitch-angle diffusion of electrons mirroring near the equator.},

	abstract = {Maintaining computational load balance is important to the performant behavior of codes which operate under a distributed computing model. This is especially true for GPU architectures, which can suffer from memory oversubscription if improperly load balanced. We present enhancements to traditional load balancing approaches and explicitly target GPU architectures, exploring the resulting performance. A key component of our enhancements is the introduction of several GPU-amenable strategies for assessing compute work. These strategies are implemented and benchmarked to find the most optimal data collection methodology for in-situ assessment of GPU compute work. For the fully kinetic particle-in-cell code WarpX, which supports MPI+CUDA parallelism, we investigate the performance of the improved dynamic load balancing via a strong scaling-based performance model and show that, for a laserion acceleration test problem run with up to 6144 GPUs on Summit, the enhanced dynamic load balancing achieves from 62\%--74\% (88\% when running on 6 GPUs) of the theoretically predicted maximum speedup; for the 96-GPU case, we find that dynamic load balancing improves performance relative to baselines without load balancing (3.8× speedup) and with static load balancing (1.2× speedup). Our results provide important insights into dynamic load balancing and performance assessment, and are particularly relevant in the context of distributed memory applications ran on GPUs.},

Investigating those scenarios requires state-of-the-art particle-in-cell (PIC) codes able to run on top high-performance computing (HPC) machines and, at the same time, able to simulate strong-field QED processes. This work presents the PICSAR-QED library, an open-source, portable implementation of a Monte Carlo module designed to provide modern PIC codes with the capability to simulate such processes, and optimized for HPC. Detailed tests and benchmarks are carried out to validate the physical models in PICSAR-QED, to study how numerical parameters affect such models, and to demonstrate its capability to run on different architectures (CPUs and GPUs). Its integration with WarpX, a state-of-the-art PIC code designed to deliver scalable performance on upcoming exascale supercomputers, is also discussed and validated against results from the existing literature.},

	abstract = {FourCastNet, short for Fourier Forecasting Neural Network, is a global data-driven weather forecasting model that provides accurate short to medium-range global predictions at \$0.25{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ resolution. FourCastNet accurately forecasts high-resolution, fast-timescale variables such as the surface wind speed, precipitation, and atmospheric water vapor. It has important implications for planning wind energy resources, predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones, and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting accuracy of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale variables, while outperforming IFS for variables with complex fine-scale structure, including precipitation. FourCastNet generates a week-long forecast in less than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than IFS. The speed of FourCastNet enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive large-ensemble forecasts with thousands of ensemble-members for improving probabilistic forecasting. We discuss how data-driven deep learning models such as FourCastNet are a valuable addition to the meteorology toolkit to aid and augment NWP models.},

	abstract = {Energetic electron precipitation from Earth’s outer radiation belt heats the upper atmosphere and alters its chemical properties. The precipitating flux intensity, typically modelled using inputs from high-altitude, equatorial spacecraft, dictates the radiation belt’s energy contribution to the atmosphere and the strength of space-atmosphere coupling. The classical quasi-linear theory of electron precipitation through moderately fast diffusive interactions with plasma waves predicts that precipitating electron fluxes cannot exceed fluxes of electrons trapped in the radiation belt, setting an apparent upper limit for electron precipitation. Here we show from low-altitude satellite observations, that {\textasciitilde}100 keV electron precipitation rates often exceed this apparent upper limit. We demonstrate that such superfast precipitation is caused by nonlinear electron interactions with intense plasma waves, which have not been previously incorporated in radiation belt models. The high occurrence rate of superfast precipitation suggests that it is important for modelling both radiation belt fluxes and space-atmosphere coupling.},

Switchbacks have been found to be systematically associated with correlated reversals in the direction of the propagation of Alfvénic fluctuations, as well as similar reversals of the electron strahl.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Here we aim to see whether the energetic particles change direction at the magnetic field switchbacks.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We use magnetic field data from the MAG suite’s fluxgate magnetometer instrument to identify switchback regions. We examine the radial anisotropy of the energetic particles measured by the EPI-Lo instrument of the IS⊙IS suite.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find that energetic particles measured by EPI-Lo generally do not preferentially change their directionality from that of the background magnetic field to that of the switchbacks.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A reasonable hypothesis is that particles with smaller gyroradii, such as strahl electrons, can reverse direction by following the magnetic field in switchbacks, but that larger gyroradii particles cannot. This provides the possibility of setting a constraint on the radius of the curvature of the magnetic field in switchbacks, a property not otherwise observed by PSP. We expect that particles at higher energies than those detectable by EPI-Lo will also not respond to switchbacks. The observed reversals of radial energetic particle flux are separate phenomena, likely associated with source locations or other propagation effects occurring at greater radial distances.},

An efficient loss process is microbursts, strong, transient precipitation of electrons over a wide energy range, from tens of keV to sub-relativistic and relativistic energies (100s keV and above). However, the detailed generation mechanism of microbursts, especially over sub-relativistic and relativistic energies, remains unknown. Here, we show that these energetic electron microbursts may be caused by ducted whistler-mode lower-band chorus waves. Using observations of equatorial chorus waves nearby low-altitude precipitation as well as data-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the observed microbursts are the result of resonant interaction of electrons with ducted chorus waves rather than nonducted ones. Revealing the physical mechanism behind the microbursts advances our understanding of radiation belt dynamics and its impact on the lower atmosphere and space weather.},

The high energies of these particles — millions of electron volts — make the belts a hazard to spacecraft. A better understanding of the mechanisms that accelerate particles to such high energies will make it easier to predict periods of enhanced risk for satellites, and a recent rare event provided an opportunity to test current models. The ‘Halloween’ solar storms of 2003 disrupted GPS and communications satellites, short-wave radio signals and power grids and caused red auroras as far south as Florida. In space, the outer of the two radiation belts was depleted, then reformed closer to Earth. Electromagnetic waves were seen to be the dominant process involved in accelerating electrons back up to speed, not the radial diffusion that had previously been suspected.},

Variability in the radiation belts is due to an imbalance between the dominant source and loss processes, caused by a violation of one or more of the adiabatic invariants. For radiation belt electrons, non-adiabatic behavior is primarily associated with energy and momentum transfer during interactions with various magnetospheric waves. A review is presented here of recent advances in both our understanding and global modeling of such wave-particle interactions, which have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of electron acceleration in the radiation belts; internal local acceleration, rather than radial diffusion now appears to be the dominant acceleration process during the recovery phase of magnetic storms.},

Kaguya found a new type of whistler-mode waves at 100 km altitude above the polar regions of the Moon with a broad frequency range of 1–16 Hz. The waves appear diffuse in both the time and frequency domains, and their occurrence is less sensitive to the magnetic connection to the lunar surface. The polarization is right-handed with respect to the background magnetic field, and the wave number vector is nearly parallel to the magnetic field perpendicular to the solar wind flow. The diffuse waves are thought to be generated by the solar wind ions reflected by the lunar magnetic field through cyclotron resonance. The resonant ions are expected to have a velocity component parallel to the magnetic field larger than the solar wind bulk speed; however, such ions were not always simultaneously detected by Kaguya. The waves may have been generated above the dayside of the Moon and then propagated along the magnetic field being convected by the solar wind to reach the polar regions to be detected by Kaguya.},

We use data from ten years of tail crossings by the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. We separate the plasma environments by magnetosheath-like, magnetotail lobe-like, and plasma sheet-like conditions. Our findings highlight that the lobe-like plasma is associated with low densities and a strong magnetic field, while the plasma sheet is characterized by higher densities and a weaker magnetic field. These regions are flanked by the fast, predominantly tailward flows of the terrestrial magnetosheath. During a single lunar crossing, however, the magnetotail displays a wide range of variability, with transient features—including reconnection events—intermixed between periods of lobe-like or sheet-like conditions. We compare and contrast the Moon’s local magnetotail plasma to the environments near various outer-planet moons. In doing so, we find that properties of the ambient lunar plasma are, at times, unique to the terrestrial magnetotail, while at others, may resemble those near the Jovian, Saturnian, and Neptunian moons. These findings highlight the complementary role of the ARTEMIS mission in providing a deeper understanding into the plasma interactions of the outer-planet moons.

We find that the fraction of the incident solar wind protons that backscatter as protons, i.e., the proton-backscattering efficiency, has an exponential dependence on the solar wind speed that varies from 0.01\% to 1\% for solar wind speeds of 250 km/s to 550 km/s. We also study the speed distribution of the backscattered protons in the fast ( 550 km/s) solar wind case and find both a peak speed at 80\% of the solar wind speed and a spread of 85 km/s. The observed flux variations and speed distribution of the backscattered protons can be explained by a speed-dependent charge state of the backscattered particles.},

	abstract = {ARTEMIS observes structures near the Moon that display many properties commonly associated with collisionless shocks, including a discontinuity with downstream compression of magnetic field and density, heating and wave activity, and velocity deflections away from the Moon. The two-probe ARTEMIS measurements show that these features do not exist in the pristine solar wind and thus must result from lunar influences. Discontinuity analyses indicate mass flux and heating across the boundary, with the normal velocity dropping from supermagnetosonic to submagnetosonic across the discontinuity. The shock location with respect to crustal magnetic fields suggests a causal relationship, implying that solar wind protons reflected from crustal fields may produce the observed structures. These observations may indicate some of the smallest shocks in the solar system (in terms of plasma scales), driven by solar wind interaction with magnetic fields on the order of the ion gyroradius and inertial length.},

	abstract = {Particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of fields, ranging from medicine and biology to high-energy physics. The accelerating fields in conventional accelerators are limited to a few tens of MeV m-1, owing to material breakdown at the walls of the structure. Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires large-scale accelerators and expensive infrastructures. Laser–plasma accelerators1 have been proposed as a next generation of compact accelerators because of the huge electric fields they can sustain2,3,4,5 ({\textgreater}100 GeV m-1). However, it has been difficult to use them efficiently for applications because they have produced poor-quality particle beams with large energy spreads2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, owing to a randomization of electrons in phase space. Here we demonstrate that this randomization can be suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble11 that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high charge of 0.5 nC at 170 MeV.},

The waves have steepened waveforms peculiarly in the compressional component. The fundamental waves have almost the same properties as narrowband whistler-mode waves with the frequencies near 1 Hz, which have been observed around the Moon. The waves are observed around the terminator region in the solar wind near the lunar magnetic anomalies at the altitudes under 120 km. We suggest that the harmonic spectra are a result of the nonlinear steepening of narrowband whistler-mode waves. Although the narrowband whistler-mode waves have been observed in the upstream region of many planetary bow shocks, such harmonics have rarely been observed there. Since the harmonics are more frequently observed at lower altitudes of the Moon, they are possibly caused by lunar intrinsic environments including lunar dusts and local structures of lunar magnetic anomalies.},

@book{yadavPlasmaWavesMoon2020,
	title = {Plasma {Waves} near the {Moon}},
	abstract = {The Moon has a thin surface bound exosphere consisting mainly inert gases helium, neon and argon. Apart from the ionosphere being generated due to the ionization of the neutral lunar atmosphere by the impinging solar UV radiation, the Moon is engulfed by some ion concentration sheaths which are associated with the lunar surface charge regions having symmetric locations. The plasma environment of Moon is not static and constantly changes when it traverses around Earth. About one-fourth of lunar orbit is not in the solar wind path when it is in the Earth's shadow, where it encounters either the tenuous plasma of the magnetospheric tail lobes or the energetic plasmas of magnetosheath and geomagnetic plasma sheet. Moon, does not possess a magnetosphere or fully developed ionosphere but has an exosphere where tenuous plasma is present to generate several plasma waves in the presence of solar wind. Plasma waves observed in the lunar wake are the high frequency electromagnetic waves at 18 kHz and 36 kHz. In lunar wake, Langmuir waves with frequency 4 kHz were also observed which got frequency and amplitude modulated at 19 kHz also with a period of 40 s. Whistler wave signals in the frequency range of 50-100 Hz were observed. During the passage through lunar wake, WIND observed that the broadband electrostatic noise (BEN) having frequency ≤ 6 kHz and a wave amplitude of 10 mV/m there. The WAVES onboard WIND also observed the reduction in electron plasma frequency consistent with the lack of electrons in lunar wake [1]. Apart from these plasma wave detections, the magnetometer onboard WIND also observed anomalous ultra-low frequency (ULF) magnetic wave activity outside the lunar wake in frequency range 0.021-5.43 Hz [2]. GEOTAIL observed left-handed, circular polarized ULF waves propagating parallel to the background magnetic field having frequency 0.3-1.2 Hz at 27 R L (Lunar radius) upstream of the Moon in lunar wake [3]. The magnetometer onboard Lunar Prospector (LP-MAG) observed monochromatic circularly polarized low frequency waves in frequency range 0.4-4 Hz in lunar vicinity and likely to be either upstream whistler waves produced at shock surfaces above lunar crustal magnetic sources or phase-standing whistlers generated by direct solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic fields. It can be observed in the figure that the largest wave powers are associated with the strongest crustal fields on the lunar surface. However, it is to be noted that the waves are observed only in the solar wind indicating that the wave generation mechanism is related with the solar wind-lunar crustal magnetic field interaction [4]. Similarly, whistler waves in the frequency range 0.03-10 Hz were observed by Kaguya in the sunlit side of Moon irrespective of the local lunar magnetic anomalies at an altitude of 100 km above the lunar surface [5]. Kaguya observed three types of electrostatic solitary waves near the Moon-type A at the wake boundaries, type B above magnetic anomalies and type C above the lunar surface without magnetic anomalies but in the solar wind. Langmuir waves in frequency range 10-20 kHz were also observed few times by instruments onboard SELENE (Kaguya) near lunar wake boundary. These waves, enhanced at local plasma frequency, were normally observed in the sunlit region and boundaries facing the Sun and in the lunar wake when the Moon is immersed in the solar wind [6]. Low frequency ion cyclotron waves, arising due to ion temperature anisotropy, in frequency range 0.04-0.17 Hz were observed at lunar surface by the lunar surface magnetometers by Apollo 15 \& 16 when the Moon was in the earth's magnetotail. The anisotropy in the ion temperature occurring near the Moon was proposed to be the reason behind the generation of these waves [7].},

The waves were observed as narrowband magnetic fluctuations with frequencies close to 1 Hz, and were mostly left-hand polarized in the spacecraft frame. We performed a statistical analysis of the waves to identify the distributions of their intensity and occurrence. The results indicate that the waves were generated by the solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic anomalies. The conditions for observation of the waves strongly depend on the solar zenith angle (SZA), and a high occurrence rate is recognized in the region of SZA between 40° to 90° with remarkable north-south and dawn-dusk asymmetries. We suggest that ion beams reflected by the lunar magnetic anomalies are a possible source of the waves.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The inferred propagation vectors and polarizations of these waves are consistent with the expected characteristics of whistler-mode waves.

In the sport of rock climbing, 5.12 is a magical grade of difficulty―the rating that separates intermediate climbers from the sport's elite. Many intermediate climbers mistakenly believe that climbs of 5.12 difficulty are simply beyond their reach. This revised and updated edition of Eric Horst's best-selling instructional manual dispels that myth, and shows average climbers how they can achieve heights previously considered the exclusive domain of the full-time climber.

How to Climb 5.12 is a performance guidebook that will help climbers attain the most rapid gains in climbing ability possible. Hörst provides streamlined tips and suggestions on such critical issues as cutting-edge strength training, mental training, and climbing strategy.

The fluctuations were almost always observed on the solar side of the moon, irrespective of the local lunar crustal field. They were also detected just nightside of the terminator (SZA {\textless} 123°), but were absent around the center of the wake. The level of the fluctuation enhanced over the wide range from 0.03 to 10 Hz, with no clear peak frequency. The fluctuations had the compressional component, and the polarization was not clear. The fluctuations were supposed to be whistler waves generated by the protons reflected by the lunar surface. The reflected protons are scattered in various directions, resulting a wide range of distribution of the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field. It may account for the wide range of frequency as observed, through cyclotron resonance of the wave with the reflected ions, in which the resonant frequency depends on the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field. However, there is also the possibility that the waves were generated by some nonresonant process.},

We find that they are clearly associated with lunar crustal sources, and sometimes occur far upstream from the limb at altitudes of ∼100 km. This is inconsistent with compressional disturbances convecting downstream with the solar wind, and implies that crustal fields are sometimes strong and coherent enough to produce a fluid-like interaction where compressional waves steepen to form a shock extending upstream from their source. The likelihood of observing enhancements partly depends on upstream solar wind conditions, with low proton gyroradius and low β particularly favored. Low Mach numbers, implying a larger shock standoff distance, are also favored for observations which suggest shock-like behavior.},

	abstract = {Using electromagnetic hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) simulations, the interaction between solar wind and a magnetized asteroid is investigated. At no or very low levels of asteroid magnetization the solar wind remains undisturbed. As the level of magnetization is increased, a phase standing whistler wake is generated which owing to its propagation characteristics remains confined to planes close to that containing the solar wind flow velocity and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). No density perturbations are associated with this wake. Further increase in asteroid magnetization results in the additional generation of fast and slow magnetosonic wakes, which fall behind the whistler wake and are associated with the formation of a plasma tail. Because of their propagation characteristics, these wakes are more symmetric than the whistler wake. At still higher levels of magnetization where plasma pileup occurs upstream of the asteroid, the fast magnetosonic wake becomes dominant and eventually exhibits shock-like behavior. In general, the size of the interaction region increases with the level of asteroid's magnetic field strength. This interaction region is highly structured and asymmetric owing to wave propagation characteristics and the IMF direction. In addition, once the fast magnetosonic wake is strong enough to result in ion reflection the subsequent E × B motion of these ions results in considerable asymmetry in the interaction region. This is a purely ion kinetic effect which comes about as a result of the overall interaction region being comparable to ion scale lengths.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations of plasma flows are crucial for advancing our understanding of microscopic processes that drive the global plasma dynamics in fusion devices, space, and astrophysical systems. Identifying and classifying particle trajectories allows us to determine specific on-going acceleration mechanisms, shedding light on essential plasma processes.Our overall goal is to provide a general workflow for exploring particle trajectory space and automatically classifying particle trajectories from plasma simulations in an unsupervised manner. We combine pre-processing techniques, such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), with Machine Learning methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-means clustering algorithms, and silhouette analysis. We demonstrate our workflow by classifying electron trajectories during magnetic reconnection problem. Our method successfully recovers existing results from previous literature without a priori knowledge of the underlying system.Our workflow can be applied to analyzing particle trajectories in different phenomena, from magnetic reconnection, shocks to magnetospheric flows. The workflow has no dependence on any physics model and can identify particle trajectories and acceleration mechanisms that were not detected before.},

We show the average scattered proton energy spectra, directional scattering distributions, and scattering efficiency, for different solar wind incidence angles and impact speeds. We find that the protons have a scattering distribution that is similar to existing empirical models for scattered hydrogen energetic neutral atoms, with a peak in the backward direction (toward the Sun). We provide a revised model for the scattered proton energy spectrum. We evaluate the positive to neutral charge state ratio by comparing the proton spectrum with existing models for scattered hydrogen. The positive to neutral ratio increases with increasing exit speed from the surface but decreases with increasing impact speed. Combined, these counteracting effects result in a scattering efficiency that decreases from 0.5\% at 300 km/s solar wind speed to 0.3\% at 600 km/s solar wind speed.},

The DL-based PIC does not conserve the total energy and momentum. However, the DL-based PIC method is stable against the cold-beam instability, affecting traditional PIC methods.

Particle-in-Cell (PIC) codes have demonstrated their success in simulating numerous plasma phenomena on HPC systems. Today, flagship supercomputers feature multiple GPUs per compute node to achieve unprecedented computing power at high power efficiency. PIC codes require new algorithm design and implementation for exploiting such accelerated platforms. In this work, we design and optimize a three-dimensional implicit PIC code, called sputniPIC, to run on a general multi-GPU compute node. We introduce a particle decomposition data layout, in contrast to domain decomposition on CPU-based implementations, to use particle batches for overlapping communication and computation on GPUs. sputniPIC also natively supports different precision representations to achieve speed up on hardware that supports reduced precision. We validate sputniPIC through the well-known GEM challenge and provide performance analysis. We test sputniPIC on three multi-GPU platforms and report a 200-800x performance improvement with respect to the sputniPIC CPU OpenMP version performance. We show that reduced precision could further improve performance by 45\% to 80\% on the three platforms. Because of these performance improvements, on a single node with multiple GPUs, sputniPIC enables large-scale three-dimensional PIC simulations that were only possible using clusters.},

In the second model a small component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the neutral sheet is added. This component not only serves to bring particles out of the sheet, but turns protons and electrons toward the same direction, 90° away from the accelerating electric field. The particles are accelerated and then ejected when they have been turned 90°, and the emergent pitch angles to a magnetic line of force will be small if the perpendicular magnetic field component is small.},

The properties of a super-Alfvénic outflow jet are attributed to an ensemble of electrons traveling through the Speiser orbits. The noncrossing orbits are mediated by the polarization electric field near the electron current layer. The noncrossing electrons are found to be non-negligible in number density. The impact of these new orbits to electron mixing, spatial distribution of energetic electrons, and observational signatures is presented.},

While high amplitude and oblique whistlers in typical 1 AU solar wind parameters are capable of forming an isotropic population without any additional processes, anomalous interactions with quasi-parallel whistlers may be essential to the process of halo formation near the Sun. High amplitude and quasi-parallel whistlers can scatter strahl electrons to low velocities (less than the wave phase velocity) to form a halo population, as long as their amplitude is sufficiently high. We also present in detail a careful treatment of the sensitivity to initial conditions based on calculations of the phase space volume, which is necessary for numerical calculations of highly stochastic motion due to resonant interactions with large amplitude waves. Our method ensures that the volume-preserving characteristic of the Boris algorithm is consistently applied for simulations of both stochastic and non-stochastic particle motion.},

	abstract = {Fast magnetosonic (MS) waves play an important role in the dynamics of the inner magnetosphere. Theoretical prediction and simulation have demonstrated that MS waves can heat cold ions. However, direct observational evidence of cold ion heating by MS waves has so far remained elusive. In this paper, we show a typical event of cold ion heating by magnetosonic waves in a density cavity of the plasmasphere with observations of the Van Allen Probe mission on 22 August 2013. During enhancements of the MS wave intensity in the density cavity, the fluxes of trapped H+ and He+ ions with energies of 10–100 eV were observed to increase, implying that cold plasmaspheric ions were heated through high-order resonances with the MS waves. Based on simultaneous observations of ring current protons, we have calculated local linear growth rates, which demonstrate that magnetosonic waves can be locally generated in the density cavity. Our results provide a direct observational proof of the energy coupling process between the ring current and plasmasphere; that is, through exciting MS waves, the free energy stored in the ring current protons with ring distributions is released. In the density cavity of the plasmasphere, both cold H+ and He+ ions are heated by MS waves. As a result, the energy of the ring current can be transferred into the plasmasphere.},

New features pycdf now supports variables with sparse records, including enabling/disabling sparse records and setting the pad value. Thanks Antoine Brunet. Deprecations and removals The colourmaps provided in the plot module have been deprecated. The same colourmaps have been available in matplotlib since at least 1.5, and users who do not directly import the colourmaps should see no impact. Dependency requirements Not all dependencies are required for all functionality; see https://spacepy.github.io/dependencies.html for full details, including what functionality is lost if a dependency is not installed. No changes since 0.2.2: numpy 1.10 and scipy 0.11 are the minimum supported versions. Major bugfixes The passing of keyword arguments from bootHisto to numpy.histogram and matplotlib.pyplot.bar has been fixed. The check for out-of-date leapseconds in time has been fixed (previously warned even when the file was up to date.) Fixed installation on new versions of setuptools, which removed bdist\_wininst support. The handling of library paths on Windows has been updated. This should fix situations where irbempy would not import on Windows with Python 3.8 or later. Other changes Modern leapsecond rules are applied from 1958-1972 rather than rounding fractional leapseconds. The handling of the .spacepy directory has been improved. If the SPACEPY environment variable is used, the directory will be created. The import process also is less fragile in the case of a partially-created .spacepy directory or an invalid (e.g. empty) spacepy.rc.},

	abstract = {Space science deals with the bodies within the solar system and the interplanetary medium; the primary focus is on atmospheres and above—at Earth the short timescale variation in the the geomagnetic field, the Van Allen radiation belts and the deposition of energy into the upper atmosphere are key areas of investigation.

SpacePy is a package for Python, targeted at the space sciences, that aims to make basic data analysis, modeling and visualization easier. It builds on the capabilities of the well-known NumPy and matplotlib packages. Publication quality output direct from analyses is emphasized. The SpacePy project seeks to promote accurate and open research standards by providing an open environment for code development. In the space physics community there has long been a significant reliance on proprietary languages that restrict free transfer of data and reproducibility of results. By providing a comprehensive library of widely-used analysis and visualization tools in a free, modern and intuitive language, we hope that this reliance will be diminished for non-commercial users.

SpacePy includes implementations of widely used empirical models, statistical techniques used frequently in space science (e.g. superposed epoch analysis), and interfaces to advanced tools such as electron drift shell calculations for radiation belt studies. SpacePy also provides analysis and visualization tools for components of the Space Weather Modeling Framework including streamline tracing in vector fields. Further development is currently underway. External libraries, which include well-known magnetic field models, high-precision time conversions and coordinate transformations are accessed from Python using ctypes and f2py. The rest of the tools have been implemented directly in Python.

The provision of open-source tools to perform common tasks will provide openness in the analysis methods employed in scientific studies and will give access to advanced tools to all space scientists, currently distribution is limited to non-commercial use.},

	abstract = {Broadband whistler-mode waves in the frequency range from 0.1 to 10 Hz are detected near the Moon by the Lunar Magnetometer (LMAG) on board Kaguya. The generation process and statistical properties of the waves have not been understood yet. We analyze the distributions of their occurrence and reveal that most of the waves are generated by the solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic field. We also clarify that the waves are observed when Kaguya is connected by the ambient magnetic field with the lunar surface. The statistical study indicates that the broadband waves are observed in the vicinity of the region where narrowband whistler-mode waves in the frequency of near 1 Hz are observed, showing the close relationship between them. The analysis of the wave vector directions suggests that these two types of waves are different views of the same waves propagating in the solar wind frame. The narrowband waves are possibly explained by a part of the broadband waves largely Doppler shifted in the spacecraft frame. The present results suggest a possible scenario of the generation process of the two types of waves through the solar wind interaction with the crustal magnetic field.},

A nonlinear BGK potential model is proposed as the generation mechanism for the ESW based upon a simple particle simulation which considers the highly nonlinear evolution of the electron beam instability. The wave forms produced by this simulation are very similar to those observed by GEOTAIL and suggest that the nonlinear dynamics of the electron beam play an essential role in the generation of ESW.},

Consequently, surface charging in these regions differs from regions without magnetic fields. Using the Colorado Solar Wind Experiment facility, this interaction is investigated with high-energy flowing plasmas (100–800 eV beam ions) that are incident upon a magnetic dipole embedded beneath an insulating surface. The dipole moment is perpendicular to the surface. The plasma potential distribution is measured above the surface using an emissive probe. In the dipole lobe regions the surface is charged to significantly higher positive potentials by the un-magnetized ion beam impinging on the surface while the electrons remain excluded by the magnetic field. At low ion beam energies the results agree with these expectations as the surface potential follows the ion beam energy. However, at high beam energies, the surface potentials in the electron-shielded lobe regions remain significantly lower than the expected magnitude. Surprisingly, electrons are detected in the shielded regions by a Langmuir probe. A test particle simulation indicates that secondary electrons induced by the high energy ion beams impinging on the surface can enter the shielded regions, thus lowering the surface potential.},

The size of this magnetic anomaly (measured as the distance from the dipole center to the position where the pressure of the local magnetic field equals the dynamic pressure of the solar wind) is one quarter that of the Larmor radius of the solar wind ions. In spite of the weak magnetization of the ions, a minimagnetosphere is formed above the magnetic anomaly. In the boundary layer of the minimagnetosphere, the electron current is dominant. Due to the intense electric field induced by charge separation, electrons entering the boundary layer undergo E × B drift. In each hemisphere, the electron boundary current due to the drift shows a structure where the convection reverses; these structures are symmetric with respect to the magnetic equator. Detailed analysis of the electron cyclotron motion shows that electrons at the edge of the inner boundary layer obtain maximum velocity by the electric field acceleration due to the charge separation, not due to the drift of the electron's guiding center. The maximum electron velocity is approximately 8 times that of the upstream plasma. The width of the boundary layer current becomes approximately equal to the radius of the local electron cyclotron.},

In contrast with recent hybrid and implicit particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic anomalies that have aimed to resolve electric fields over several tens of kilometers, kinetic simulations reveal a much smaller scale regime in which magnetically driven ion-electron separation can generate a kV potential difference over a height of less than 200 m. The resulting electric field structure varies considerably between dawn and noon (when the solar wind flows, respectively, horizontally across the surface and vertically down from above) and is strong enough to reflect some ions back into space, consistent with spacecraft observations. Ion velocity and energy distributions are extracted near the surface and are used to derive maps of ion flux and impact energy, and the effects on sputtering and defect formation within the regolith are discussed. However, considerable uncertainty remains in how the surface ion flux evolves throughout a lunar day and how the plasma-surface-magnetic field interaction changes with respect to different magnetic topologies.},

	abstract = {We present results from a new grid-free 2D plasma simulation code applied to a small, unmagnetized body immersed in the streaming solar wind plasma. The body was purposely modeled as an irregular shape in order to examine photoemission and solar wind plasma flow in high detail on the dayside, nightside, terminator and surface-depressed ‘pocket’ regions. Our objective is to examine the overall morphology of the various plasma interaction regions that form around a small body like a small near-Earth asteroid (NEA). We find that the object obstructs the solar wind flow and creates a trailing wake region downstream, which involves the interplay between surface charging and ambipolar plasma expansion. Photoemission is modeled as a steady outflow of electrons from illuminated portions of the surface, and under direct illumination the surface forms a non-monotonic or “double-sheath” electric potential upstream of the body, which is important for understanding trajectories and equilibria of lofted dust grains in the presence of a complex asteroid geometry. The largest electric fields are found at the terminators, where ambipolar plasma expansion in the body-sized nightside wake merges seamlessly with the thin photoelectric sheath on the dayside. The pocket regions are found to be especially complex, with nearby sunlit regions of positive potential electrically connected to unlit negative potentials and forming adjacent natural electric dipoles. For objects near the surface, we find electrical dissipation times (through collection of local environmental solar wind currents) that vary over at least 5 orders of magnitude: from 39μs inside the near-surface photoelectron cloud under direct sunlight to ≫1s inside the particle-depleted nightside wake and shadowed pocket regions.},

	abstract = {A common approach to modeling kinetic problems in plasma physics is to represent the plasma as a set of Lagrangian macro-particles which interact through long-range forces. In the well-known particle-in-cell (PIC) method, the particle charges are interpolated to a mesh and the fields are obtained using a fast Poisson solver. The advantage of this approach is that the electrostatic forces can be evaluated in time O(NlogN), where N is the number of macro-particles, but the scheme has difficulty resolving steep gradients and handling nonconforming domains unless a sufficiently fine mesh is used. The current work describes a grid-free alternative, the boundary integral/treecode (BIT) method. Using Green's theorem, we express the solution to Poisson's equation as the sum of a volume integral and a boundary integral which are computed using particle discretizations. The treecode replaces particle-particle interactions by particle-cluster interactions which are evaluated by Taylor expansions. In addition, the Green's function is regularized and adaptive particle insertion is implemented to maintain resolution. Like PIC, the operation count is O(NlogN), but BIT avoids using a regular grid, so it can potentially resolve steep gradients and handle complex domains more efficiently. We applied BIT to several bounded plasma problems including a one-dimensional (1-D) sheath in direct current (dc) discharges, 1-D virtual cathode, cold two-stream instability, two-dimensional (2-D) planar and cylindrical ion optics, and particle dynamics in a Penning-Malmberg trap. Some comparisons of BIT and PIC were performed. These results and ongoing work will be reviewed.},

The data used in the present study consist of about 5 million observations of the lunar magnetic field at 10–45 km altitudes by Kaguya and Lunar Prospector. The lunar magnetic anomalies were mapped at 0.2° equi-distance points on the surface by the SVM method, showing the highest intensity of 718 nT in the Crisium antipodal region. Overall features on the SVM maps indicate that elongating magnetic anomalies are likely to be dominant on the Moon except for the young large basins with the impact demagnetization. Remarkable demagnetization features suggested by previous studies are also recognized at Hertzsprung and Kolorev craters on the farside. These features indicate that demagnetized areas extend to about 1–2 radii of the basins/craters. There are well-isolated central magnetic anomalies at four craters: Leibnitz, Aitken, Jules Verne, and Grimaldi craters. Their magnetic poles through the dipole source approximation suggest occurrence of the polar wander prior to 3.3–3.5 Ga. When compared with high-albedo markings at several magnetic anomalies such as the Reiner Gamma anomalies, three-dimensional structures of the magnetic field on/near the surface are well correlated with high-albedo areas. These results indicate that the global SVM maps are useful for the study of the lunar magnetic anomalies in comparison with various geological and geophysical data.},

	abstract = {Spacecraft observations show that weak magnetic fields of crustal origin are ubiquitous across the surface of the Moon. To investigate the origin of these magnetic anomalies, a model was developed for the magnetic power spectrum that consists of ensembles of randomly magnetized sills or prisms. Localized spectrum analyses constrained how the parameters of this model vary with position, including the size of the sources, a quantity proportional to their mean-squared dipole moment, and the depth to the top and bottom of the magnetized region. The depth to the top of the magnetized region varies from the surface to about 25 km. The magnetic carriers in the deep crust likely formed at the same time as the crust itself, implying that a core-generated dynamo field must have existed when the crust was cooling during the first 100 Myr of lunar evolution. The parameter related to the strength of magnetization shows the existence of a prominent region on the nearside hemisphere that is largely unmagnetized and that correlates with a region of extremely low surface field strengths. This region lies entirely within a geological province that is highly enriched in heat-producing elements (the Procellarum KREEP Terrane), suggesting that this region escaped being magnetized because of prolonged high crustal temperatures. The nearside magnetic low may be representative of the size of that portion of the crust that is highly enriched in heat-producing elements, which is almost one third the size of the Procellarum KREEP Terrane based on surface thorium abundances.},

However, their association with the global distribution of lunar magnetic anomalies have not been fully characterized. Here we exploit polar orbiting Kaguya to generate first global maps of electrostatic waves and solar wind electron modification above the day side of the Moon. The maps clearly demonstrate that the two signatures are correlated with lunar crustal magnetic fields. Additionally, we observe different characteristics of electron modification for different interplanetary magnetic field orientations. The lunar crustal magnetic fields cause a wide range of reflected electron and ion intensities, thereby serving as a test bed to investigate the relative roles of reflected particles on wave excitation and particle heating.},

	abstract = {Wave–particle interactions are fundamental processes in space plasma, and some plasma waves, including electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs), are recognised as broadband noises (BBNs) in the electric field spectral data. Spacecraft observations in recent decades have detected BBNs around the Moon, but the generation mechanism of the BBNs is not fully understood. Here, we study a wake boundary traversal with BBNs observed by Kaguya, which includes an ESW event previously reported by Hashimoto et al. Geophys Res Lett 37:L19204 https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044529(2010). Focusing on the relation between BBNs and electron pitch-angle distribution functions, we show that upward electron beams from the nightside lunar surface are effective for the generation of BBNs, in contrast to the original interpretation by Hashimoto et al. Geophys Res Lett 37:L19204 https://doi.org/10.1029/2010GL044529(2010) that high-energy electrons accelerated by strong ambipolar electric fields excite ESWs in the region far from the Moon. When the BBNs were observed by the Kaguya spacecraft in the wake boundary, the spacecraft’s location was magnetically connected to the nightside lunar surface, and bi-streaming electron distributions of downward-going solar wind strahl component and upward-going field-aligned beams (at \$\${\textbackslash}sim\$\$124 eV) were detected. The interplanetary magnetic field was dominated by a positive \$\$B\_Z\$\$(i.e. the northward component), and strahl electrons travelled in the antiparallel direction to the interplanetary magnetic field (i.e. southward), which enabled the strahl electrons to precipitate onto the nightside lunar surface directly. The incident solar wind electrons cause negative charging of the nightside lunar surface, which generates downward electric fields that accelerate electrons from the nightside surface toward higher altitudes along the magnetic field. The bidirectional electron distribution is not a sufficient condition for the BBN generation, and the distribution of upward electron beams seems to be correlated with the BBNs. Ambipolar electric fields in the wake boundary should also contribute to the electron acceleration toward higher altitudes and further intrusion of the solar wind ions into the deeper wake. We suggest that solar wind ion intrusion into the wake boundary is also an important factor that controls the BBN generation by facilitating the influx of solar wind electrons there.},

	abstract = {The reflection of the solar wind protons is equivalent to a beam injection against the solar wind flow. It is expected to produce a ring beam with a 3D distribution function in many cases. The reflected protons are responsible for the generation of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves at ˜0.01 Hz and narrowband waves at ˜1 Hz in the extremely low frequency (ELF) range through resonant interaction with magnetohydrodynamic waves and whistler mode waves in the solar wind, respectively. This chapter discusses these commonly observed waves in the near-Moon space. The sinusoidal waveforms and sharp spectra of the monochromatic ELF waves are impressive, but commonly observed are non-monochromatic waves in the ELF range ˜0.03-10 Hz. Some of the solar wind protons reflected by the dayside lunar surface or crustal magnetic field gyrate around the solar wind magnetic field and can access the center of the wake owing to the large Larmour radius.},

	abstract = {Low-frequency waves in space plasmas have been studied for several decades, and our knowledge gain has been incremental with several paradigm-changing leaps forward. In our solar system, such waves occur in the ionospheres and magnetospheres of planets, and around our Moon. They occur in the solar wind, and more recently, they have been confirmed in the Sun’s atmosphere as well. The goal of wave research is to understand their generation, their propagation, and their interaction with the surrounding plasma. Low-frequency Waves in Space Plasmas presents a concise and authoritative up-to-date look on where wave research stands: What have we learned in the last decade? What are unanswered questions? 

While in the past waves in different astrophysical plasmas have been largely treated in separate books, the unique feature of this monograph is that it covers waves in many plasma regions, including:

- Waves in geospace, including ionosphere and magnetosphere
- Waves in planetary magnetospheres
- Waves at the Moon
- Waves in the solar wind
- Waves in the solar atmosphere

Because of the breadth of topics covered, this volume should appeal to a broad community of space scientists and students, and it should also be of interest to astronomers/astrophysicists who are studying space plasmas beyond our Solar System.},

	abstract = {Large amplitude, monochromatic ultra low frequency (ULF) waves were detected by MAP/LMAG magnetometer onboard Kaguya during the period from 1 January 2008 to 30 November 2008 on its orbit 100 km above the lunar surface. The dominant frequency was 8.3 × 10−3 – 1.0 × 10−2 Hz, corresponding to the periods of 120 s – 100 s. The amplitude was as large as 3 nT. They were observed in 10\% of the time when the moon was in the solar wind far upstream of the Earth's bow shock. They were detected only by Kaguya on the orbit around the moon, but not by ACE in the upstream solar wind. The occurrence rate was high above the terminator and on the dayside surface. The direction of the propagation was not exactly parallel to the interplanetary magnetic field, but showed a preference to the direction of the magnetic field and the direction perpendicular to the surface of the moon below the spacecraft. The sense of rotation of the magnetic field was left-handed with respect to the magnetic field in 53\% of the events, while 47\% showed right-handed polarization. The possible generation mechanism is the cyclotron resonance of the magnetohydrodynamic waves with the solar wind protons reflected by the moon. The energy of the reflected protons can account for the energy of the ULF waves. The propagation direction which are not parallel to the incident solar wind flow can explain the observed frequency and the nearly equal percentages of the left-handed and right-handed polarizations.},

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.},

	abstract = {Despite impressive results, deep learning-based technologies also raise severe privacy and environmental concerns induced by the training procedure often conducted in datacenters. In response, alternatives to centralized training such as Federated Learning (FL) have emerged. Perhaps unexpectedly, FL, in particular, is starting to be deployed at a global scale by companies that must adhere to new legal demands and policies originating from governments and civil society for privacy protection. However, the potential environmental impact related to FL remains unclear and unexplored. This paper offers the first-ever systematic study of the carbon footprint of FL. First, we propose a rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions. Then, we compare the carbon footprint of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our findings show that FL, despite being slower to converge in some cases, may result in a comparatively greener impact than a centralized equivalent setup. We performed extensive experiments across different types of datasets, settings, and various deep learning models with FL. Finally, we highlight and connect the reported results to the future challenges and trends in FL to reduce its environmental impact, including algorithms efficiency, hardware capabilities, and stronger industry transparency.},

	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

	abstract = {Here we present a machine learning framework and model implementation that can learn to simulate a wide variety of challenging physical domains, involving fluids, rigid solids, and deformable materials interacting with one another. Our framework—which we term "Graph Network-based Simulators" (GNS)—represents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.},

	abstract = {On time-series data, most causal discovery methods fit a new model whenever they encounter samples from a new underlying causal graph. However, these samples often share relevant information which is lost when following this approach. Specifically, different samples may share the dynamics which describe the effects of their causal relations. We propose Amortized Causal Discovery, a novel framework that leverages such shared dynamics to learn to infer causal relations from time-series data. This enables us to train a single, amortized model that infers causal relations across samples with different underlying causal graphs, and thus leverages the shared dynamics information. We demonstrate experimentally that this approach, implemented as a variational model, leads to significant improvements in causal discovery performance, and show how it can be extended to perform well under added noise and hidden confounding.},

In the past, possible transit-like events identified by the WASP pipeline have been vetted by human inspection to eliminate false alarms and obvious false positives. The goal of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of machine learning as a fast, automated, and reliable means of performing the same functions on ground-based wide-field transit-survey data without human intervention. To this end, we have created training and test data sets made up of stellar light curves showing a variety of signal types including planetary transits, eclipsing binaries, variable stars, and non-periodic signals. We use a combination of machine-learning methods including Random Forest Classifiers (RFCs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish between the different types of signals. The final algorithms correctly identify planets in the test data ∼90 per cent of the time, although each method on its own has a significant fraction of false positives. We find that in practice, a combination of different methods offers the best approach to identifying the most promising exoplanet transit candidates in data from WASP, and by extension similar transit surveys.},

We developed and implemented a new relativistic particle mover in iPIC3D, an implicit Particle-in-Cell code, to correctly model the dynamics of energetic particles. Before the onset of magnetic reconnection, energetic electrons are found localized close to current sheet and accelerated by lower hybrid drift instability. During magnetic reconnection, energetic particles are found in the reconnection region along the x-line and in the separatrices region. The energetic electrons are first present in localized stripes of the separatrices and finally cover all the separatrix surfaces. Along the separatrices, regions with strong electron deceleration are found. In the reconnection region, two categories of electron trajectory are identified. First, part of the electrons are trapped in the reconnection region, bouncing a few times between the outflow jets. Second, part of the electrons pass the reconnection region without being trapped. Different from electrons, energetic ions are localized on the reconnection fronts of the outflow jets.},

Square One brings together leading scholars, community advocates, policy-makers, and practitioners to consider the question of justice in America.This issue of Dædalus includes essays from two of the Square One roundtable meetings. The first, “Examining Criminalization, Punitive Excess, and the Courts in the United States: Implications for Justice Policy and Practice,” was held in partnership with Merritt College in Oakland, California, in the spring of 2019. The second, “Examining Violence in the United States: Implications for Justice Policy and Practice,” was cohosted by the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, in the fall of 2019. At each roundtable, a diverse group of twenty-five to thirty experts from academia, advocacy, and the justice system worked to develop ideas, generate writing and research,1 and design policies to build a new model of justice that helps heal the wounds of racism and poverty that lie at the heart of much of the contemporary criminal justice system.},

	abstract = {今天是俄罗斯对乌克兰发动战争的第48天。关于这场战争，我们不应该仅仅看到战线的推进、机甲的对垒、肉身的搏击，更应看到那些流离失所的妇女、儿童和宠物，那些站在历史的十字路口纠结是去是留的人们。战争不应该仅仅指涉前线、交火、武器的规模和兵力，它意味着牺牲、死伤，以及无数普通人支离破碎的生活。战争既是对物理空间的狂轰滥炸，也令精神世界一片荒芜。战争既是男人的，也是女人的。

“女人的战争有自己的色彩，有自己的气息，有自己的解读，有自己的感情空间。她们都是在用自己的语言说话。没有英雄豪杰和令人难以置信的壮举，只有普普通通的人，被迫赶着非人力所及的人类事业。”在《战争中没有女性》中，阿列克谢耶维奇试图让女性关于战争的声音、语言、情感、记忆浮出历史地表。在那一套被军事话语和国家的军事化想象规训过的语言背后，在那一套男性谈论战争的语言背后，流动着女性的悲切、悔恨、错过的青春和蹉跎的一生。

在此刻试图从性别的角度谈论这场战争，意味着揭露一种既存的、根深蒂固的性别化的权力结构，意味着去关注每一个具体的女性——拿起武器保卫家园的女兵、在战区可能遭遇士兵性侵的女性、诞下新生儿的代孕母亲、带着孩子越过边境的女性等等，意味着辨析现有权力结构是如何一边依赖着女性的生产和再生产，一边抹杀女性的功绩，并将历史盖棺论定。同时，这也意味着寻找女性讨论政治的语言——我们能否以一种不那么弱肉强食的、丛林法则的形式想象政治，能否打破公共领域和私人领域的虚假二分法，能否重新定义政治。政治不仅是政治精英的博弈、大国的权谋和宏大的政策，政治也是后院和厨房、衣柜和舞厅，也是一个个活生生的个体具体的情感和私人生活。},

我们在节目中相互探寻、反复讨论。本期嘉宾、心理咨询师张春拆解我们提出的概念，比如“政治性抑郁”，拆解我们预设的一些前提，比如感到痛苦或抑郁是不健康的。我们则对她提出的主体性假设抱有疑问，人在每时每刻都能做出自己的选择吗？当面对巨大的无处不在的外部权威时，我们该遵从还是对抗？

我们也在节目中相互倾听、彼此疗愈。在张春看来，我们的设问体现了人居于动荡世界中的不安全感，我们急切地盼望一个确切的解决方案，一种能够抵挡“政治性抑郁”的方法，一个何时何种状态该寻求心理咨询的指导。但人感受到不解、痛苦、愤怒是再正常不过的反应，是人作为有机体自然的新陈代谢，也是一种自我保护机制，这种机制帮助我们更好地应对此刻。对于四十岁戴上眼镜、苦于从未被命名的“视力矫正型抑郁”的张春来说，建国和适野的存在让她不再孤单，因为我们共享同一种感受——在第一次戴上眼镜或者更换眼镜之后、面对一个或清晰或扭曲的世界时的错愕。

在张春的心理咨询工作中，她努力理解来访者在说什么，尽量用具体的感受代替宏大的词汇，因为这种理解和沟通的尝试本身就意味着“我们此时此刻在一起、在这里，这件事情本身就是温暖的，就会有它的效果”。希望听完这期节目的你们，在这里，在此刻，也能获得些许治愈。},

	abstract = {Naturally occurring chorus emissions are a class of electromagnetic waves found in the space environments of the Earth and other magnetized planets. They play an essential role in accelerating high-energy electrons forming the hazardous radiation belt environment. Chorus typically occurs in two distinct frequency bands separated by a gap. The origin of this two-band structure remains a 50-year old question. Here we report, using NASA’s Van Allen Probe measurements, that banded chorus waves are commonly accompanied by two separate anisotropic electron components. Using numerical simulations, we show that the initially excited single-band chorus waves alter the electron distribution immediately via Landau resonance, and suppress the electron anisotropy at medium energies. This naturally divides the electron anisotropy into a low and a high energy components which excite the upper-band and lower-band chorus waves, respectively. This mechanism may also apply to the generation of chorus waves in other magnetized planetary magnetospheres.},

	abstract = {Linear kinetic dispersion analysis and a two-dimensional electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulation are performed to demonstrate a possible excitation mechanism of banded whistler waves in the magnetosphere outside of the plasmapause. Whistler waves in the lower and the upper bands can be generated simultaneously by the whistler anisotropy instability driven by two bi-Maxwellian electron components with T⊥/T∥ {\textgreater} 1 at different T∥, independently, where ∥ and ⊥ denote directions relative to the background geomagnetic field. Given ωe/Ωe, the ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron cyclotron frequency, T∥ of each electron component determines the properties of the excited waves. For the typical magnetospheric condition of 1 {\textless} ωe/Ωe {\textless} 5 in regions associated with strong chorus emissions, the present study suggests that upper-band waves can be excited by anisotropic electrons below ∼1 keV, while lower-band waves are excited by anisotropic electrons above ∼10 keV. The resultant lower-band waves are generally field-aligned and substantially electromagnetic. However, the excited upper-band waves generally propagate obliquely to the background geomagnetic field with quasi-electrostatic fluctuating electric fields.},

	abstract = {We develop a nonlinear wave growth theory of magnetospheric chorus emissions, taking into account the spatial inhomogeneity of the static magnetic field and the plasma density variation along the magnetic field line. We derive theoretical expressions for the nonlinear growth rate and the amplitude threshold for the generation of self-sustaining chorus emissions. We assume that nonlinear growth of a whistler mode wave is initiated at the magnetic equator where the linear growth rate maximizes. Self-sustaining emissions become possible when the wave propagates away from the equator during which process the increasing gradients of the static magnetic field and electron density provide the conditions for nonlinear growth. The amplitude threshold is tested against both observational data and self-consistent particle simulations of the chorus emissions. The self-sustaining mechanism can result in a rising tone emission covering the frequency range of 0.1–0.7 Ωe0, where Ωe0 is the equatorial electron gyrofrequency. During propagation, higher frequencies are subject to stronger dispersion effects that can destroy the self-sustaining mechanism. We obtain a pair of coupled differential equations for the wave amplitude and frequency. Solving the equations numerically, we reproduce a rising tone of VLF whistler mode emissions that is continuous in frequency. Chorus emissions, however, characteristically occur in two distinct frequency ranges, a lower band and an upper band, separated at half the electron gyrofrequency. We explain the gap by means of the nonlinear damping of the longitudinal component of a slightly oblique whistler mode wave packet propagating along the inhomogeneous static magnetic field.},

With the advent of graphical processing units (GPUs), large-scale plasma simulations on inexpensive GPU clusters are in reach. We present an implementation of a fully relativistic plasma PIC algorithm for GPUs based on the NVIDIA CUDA library. It supports a hybrid architecture consisting of single computation nodes interconnected in a standard cluster topology, with each node carrying one or more GPUs. The internode communication is realized using the message-passing interface. The simulation code PIConGPU presented in this paper is, to our knowledge, the first scalable GPU cluster implementation of the PIC algorithm in plasma physics.},

	abstract = {Whether the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations can develop a singularity in finite time from smooth initial data is one of the most challenging problems in mathematical fluid dynamics. This work attempts to provide an affirmative answer to this long-standing open question from a numerical point of view by presenting a class of potentially singular solutions to the Euler equations computed in axisymmetric geometries. The solutions satisfy a periodic boundary condition along the axial direction and a no-flow boundary condition on the solid wall. The equations are discretized in space using a hybrid 6th-order Galerkin and 6th-order finite difference method on specially designed adaptive (moving) meshes that are dynamically adjusted to the evolving solutions. With a maximum effective resolution of over \$(3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}){\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ near the point of the singularity, we are able to advance the solution up to \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{2\} = 0.003505\$ and predict a singularity time of \$t\_\{s\} {\textbackslash}approx 0.0035056\$, while achieving a pointwise relative error of \$O(10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\})\$ in the vorticity vector \${\textbackslash}omega\$ and observing a \$(3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\})\$-fold increase in the maximum vorticity \${\textbackslash}lVert{\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}rVert\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$. The numerical data are checked against all major blowup/non-blowup criteria, including Beale--Kato--Majda, Constantin--Fefferman--Majda, and Deng--Hou--Yu, to confirm the validity of the singularity. A local analysis near the point of the singularity also suggests the existence of a self-similar blowup in the meridian plane.},

Prototypical Networks learn a metric space in which classification can be performed by computing distances to prototype representations of each class. Compared to recent approaches for few-shot learning, they reflect a simpler inductive bias that is beneficial in this limited-data regime, and achieve excellent results. We provide an analysis showing that some simple design decisions can yield substantial improvements over recent approaches involving complicated architectural choices and meta-learning. We further extend Prototypical Networks to zero-shot learning and achieve state-of-the-art results on the CU-Birds dataset.},

	shorttitle = {{FedProto}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00243},
	abstract = {Heterogeneity across clients in federated learning (FL) usually hinders the optimization convergence and generalization performance when the aggregation of clients' knowledge occurs in the gradient space. For example, clients may differ in terms of data distribution, network latency, input/output space, and/or model architecture, which can easily lead to the misalignment of their local gradients. To improve the tolerance to heterogeneity, we propose a novel federated prototype learning (FedProto) framework in which the clients and server communicate the abstract class prototypes instead of the gradients. FedProto aggregates the local prototypes collected from different clients, and then sends the global prototypes back to all clients to regularize the training of local models. The training on each client aims to minimize the classification error on the local data while keeping the resulting local prototypes sufficiently close to the corresponding global ones. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis to the convergence rate of FedProto under non-convex objectives. In experiments, we propose a benchmark setting tailored for heterogeneous FL, with FedProto outperforming several recent FL approaches on multiple datasets.},

	abstract = {Ion Bernstein modes, also known as magnetosonic waves in the magnetospheric community, are considered to play an important role in radiation belt electron acceleration. The detailed properties of perpendicular magnetosonic waves excited in the inner magnetosphere by a tenuous proton ring distribution are investigated in a two series paper with a combination of the linear theory and one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Here, in this paper, we study the properties of the excited magnetosonic waves under different plasma conditions with the linear theory. When the proton to electron mass ratio or the ratio of the light speed to the Alfven speed is small, the excited magnetosonic waves are prone to having a discrete spectrum with only several wave modes. With the increase of the proton to electron mass ratio or the ratio of the light speed to the Alfven speed, the lower hybrid frequency also increases, which leads to the increase of both the number and frequency of the excited wave modes. Meanwhile, the growth rate of these wave modes also increases. When the proton to electron mass ratio or the ratio of the light speed to the Alfven speed is sufficiently large, the spectrum of the excited magnetic waves becomes continuous due to the overlapping of the adjacent wave modes. The increase of the density of the protons with the ring distribution can also result in the increase of the growth rate, which may also change the discrete spectrum of the excited waves to a continuous one, while the increase of the ring velocity of the tenuous proton ring distribution leads to a broader spectrum, but with a smaller growth rate.},

	abstract = {The most important parameter driving the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction is the southward (Bz) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). While the dawn-dusk (By) component of the IMF is also known to play an important role, its effects are usually assumed to be independent of its sign. Here we demonstrate for the first time a seasonally varying, explicit IMF By-dependence of the ring current and Dst index. Using satellite observations and a global magnetohydrodynamic model coupled with a ring current model, we show that for a fixed level of solar wind driving the flux of energetic magnetospheric protons and the growth-rate of the ring current are greater for By {\textless} 0 (By {\textgreater} 0) than for By {\textgreater} 0 (By {\textless} 0) in Northern Hemisphere summer (winter). While the physical mechanism of this explicit By-effect is not yet fully understood, our results suggest that IMF By modulates magnetospheric convection and plasma transport in the inner magnetosphere.},

SLATE will provide coverage of existing ScaLAPACK functionality, including the parallel BLAS; linear systems using LU and Cholesky; least squares problems using QR; and eigenvalue and singular value problems. In this respect, it will serve as a replacement for ScaLAPACK, which after two decades of operation, cannot adequately be retrofitted for modern accelerated architectures. SLATE uses modern techniques such as communication-avoiding algorithms, lookahead panels to overlap communication and computation, and task-based scheduling, along with a modern C++ framework. Here we present the design of SLATE and initial reports of several of its components.},

We focus especially on the methods designed to overcome the difficulties created by the tremendous range of time and space scales present in the physical systems. We review the aspects of the derivation of the particle in cell (PIC) method relevant to the discussion. We consider first the explicit formulation highlighting its severe limitations due to the presence of stability constraints. Next we introduce implicit methods designed to remove such constraints. We describe both fully implicit methods based on the use of non-linear iteration solvers and semi-implicit methods based on the linearization of the coupling and on simpler linear solvers. We focus the discussion on the implicit moment method but remark its differences from the direct implicit method. The application of adaptive methods within PIC is discussed. Finally practical considerations about the implementation of the implicit PIC method on massively parallel computers to conduct studies of space weather events are given.},

We investigate whether the synchrotron maser emission from relativistic shocks in a magnetar wind can explain the observed FRB properties. We perform particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of perpendicular shocks in cold pair plasmas, checking our results for consistency among three PIC codes. We confirm that a linearly polarized X-mode wave is self-consistently generated by the shock and propagates back upstream as a precursor wave. We find that at magnetizations σ ≳ 1 (i.e. ratio of Poynting flux to particle energy flux of the pre-shock flow) the shock converts a fraction \$f\_{\textbackslash}xi {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} {\textbackslash}approx 7 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}/{\textbackslash}sigma {\textasciicircum}2\$ of the total incoming energy into the precursor wave, as measured in the shock frame. The wave spectrum is narrow-band (fractional width ≲1−3), with apparent but not dominant line-like features as many resonances concurrently contribute. The peak frequency in the pre-shock (observer) frame is \${\textbackslash}omega {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime {\textbackslash}prime \}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\} {\textbackslash}approx 3 {\textbackslash}gamma \_\{{\textbackslash}rm s {\textbar} u\} {\textbackslash}omega \_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\}\$, where γs{\textbar}u is the shock Lorentz factor in the upstream frame and ωp the plasma frequency. At σ ≳ 1, where our estimated \${\textbackslash}omega {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime {\textbackslash}prime \}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}\$ differs from previous works, the shock structure presents two solitons separated by a cavity, and the peak frequency corresponds to an eigenmode of the cavity. Our results provide physically grounded inputs for FRB emission models within the magnetar scenario.},

The code is combining the latest algorithmic advances (e.g., Lorentz boosted frame and pseudo-spectral Maxwell solvers) with mesh refinement and runs on the latest computer processing unit and graphical processing unit (GPU) architectures. In this paper, we summarize the strategy that was adopted to port WarpX to GPUs, report on the weak parallel scaling of the pseudo-spectral electromagnetic solver, and then present solutions for decreasing the time spent in data exchanges from guard regions between subdomains. In Sec. IV, we demonstrate the simulations of a chain of three consecutive multi-GeV laser-driven plasma accelerator stages.},

To date, there have been relatively few direct comparisons of these codes in the literature, especially for relativistic intensity lasers interacting with thin overdense targets. To address this, we perform a code comparison of three PIC codes: EPOCH, LSP, and WarpX for the problem of laser-driven ion acceleration in a 2D(3v) geometry for a 1020 W cm−2 intensity laser. We examine the plasma density, ion energy spectra, and laser–plasma coupling of the three codes and find strong agreement. We also run the same simulation 20 times with different random seeds to explore statistical fluctuations of the outputs. We then compare the execution times and memory usage of the codes (without “tuning” to improve performance) using between 1 and 48 processors on one node. We provide input files to encourage larger and more frequent code comparisons in this field.},

	abstract = {作者简介:
伊莎贝尔·阿连德（Isabel Allende，1942－）,她出身智利的名门世家，萨尔瓦多·阿连德总统是她的伯父。她在一个奇妙的大家庭长大，外祖母为她打开了探索神秘世界的心灵之门。 1973年，智利发生流血政变事件，她踏上流亡之路。 1981年，99岁的外祖父决定绝食自杀，她写给他一封长信，这就是《幽灵之家》。 1992年，29岁的爱女因病去世。她用文字让自己变得更坚强。

内容简介:
这是一部气度恢宏的全景式小说。它以30万字的篇幅展现了一个拉丁美洲国家从本世纪初到1973年为止风云变幻的历史。以埃斯特万·特鲁埃瓦家族的兴衰变化为中心线索讲述了两个家族四代人之间的恩怨纠葛，生动形象地描写了在历史大变迁中各个阶级、各个阶层人物为生活、思想状况。作者继承了拉美文学“贴近现实”的优良传统，同“文学爆炸”中杰出的作家保持着同一创作方向，表现出强烈的社会责任感。尤其可贵的是，作者一方面对描写的事件、人物保持着清晰的认识，爱憎分明；另一方面又没有囿于个人好恶，使对事件的评价流于简单化，对人物的刻画流于脸谱化。该书出版后，受到了广大读者的欢迎，并引起文学界的重视，原因之一是作者不拘一格地综合运用了传统的和时兴的写作技巧和创作方法，收到了雅俗共赏的效果。塑造典型环境中的典型性格，是伊莎贝尔·阿连德刻意追求的目标。
这部小说具有很强的故事性。伊莎贝尔·阿连德不愧是个讲故事的能手，在书中引人入胜的故事一个接着一个，或离奇，或荒诞，或惊心动魄，或缠绵悱恻，读起来令人不忍释卷。拉丁美洲文学评论家把《幽灵之家》归入魔幻现实主义文学流派。把它誉为继《百年孤独》之后魔幻现实主义的又一部力作。
阿连德创作了一部波澜壮阔、扣人心弦的史诗，其中充满了残酷凶猛的斗争和激情四溢的浪漫。
这是一位天才故事家华丽登场的传奇之作。1993年，它被改编成电影《金色豪门》，梅丽尔·斯特里普、安东尼奥·班德拉斯、薇诺娜·赖德等明星荟萃。它至少被译成30种语言，仅德国销量已逾三百万。2004年，她由被欧洲读者评为百本最喜爱的图书之一。一片神奇遥远的土地，一段风云变幻的历史，一群坚强而多情的男人和女人在其间活着，笑着，流泪，死去。他们，就是特鲁埃瓦家族，走进这个世界，你将流连忘返，刻骨铭心。},

	abstract = {Using the Parker Solar Probe FIELDS bandpass-filter data and SWEAP electron data from Encounters 1 through 9, we show statistical properties of narrowband whistlers from ∼16 R s to ∼130 R s, and compare wave occurrence to electron properties including beta, temperature anisotropy, and heat flux. Whistlers are very rarely observed inside ∼28 R s (∼0.13 au). Outside 28 R s, they occur within a narrow range of parallel electron beta from ∼1 to 10, and with a beta-heat flux occurrence consistent with the whistler heat flux fan instability. Because electron distributions inside ∼30 R s display signatures of the ambipolar electric field, the lack of whistlers suggests that the modification of the electron distribution function associated with the ambipolar electric field or changes in other plasma properties must result in lower instability limits for the other modes (including the observed solitary waves and ion acoustic waves) that are observed close to the Sun. The lack of narrowband whistler-mode waves close to the Sun and in regions of either low ({\textless}0.1) or high ({\textgreater}10) beta is also significant for the understanding and modeling of the evolution of flare-accelerated electrons and the regulation of heat flux in astrophysical settings including other stellar winds, the interstellar medium, accretion disks, and the intragalaxy cluster medium.},

	abstract = {The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission observes precipitating solar wind hydrogen ENAs in the upper Martian ionosphere with various instruments onboard. These precipitating solar wind hydrogen atoms result from the direct interaction between the solar wind and Mars's extensive hydrogen corona, creating a beam of particles traveling at solar wind speed that can penetrate deep into the ionosphere of Mars. Using particle data collected by both the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) and Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) onboard MAVEN, we seek to characterize the global behavior of these particles. By using a combination of energy spectra and neutral gas density data, we are able to determine the behavior of this particle population as a function of altitude, column density, and solar zenith angle. Through our analysis, we see that these precipitating solar wind hydrogen ENAs undergo multiple charge exchange interactions and ultimately scatter significantly at an altitude of 160 km or column density of 5 × 1016 cm−2. This observed column density at which equilibrium is reached is at a value ∼17 times greater than the theoretical value. We also demonstrate that this particle population's energy flux follows a cosine dependence of solar zenith angle, as is predicted by models.},

In this paper, we present an exploration of on-device FL on various smartphones and embedded devices using the Flower framework.

	abstract = {The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems has led to the problem of managing and analyzing the large volumes of data that they generate. Traditional approaches that involve collection of data from IoT devices into one centralized repository for further analysis are not always applicable due to the large amount of collected data, the use of communication channels with limited bandwidth, security and privacy requirements, etc. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach that allows one to analyze data directly on data sources and to federate the results of each analysis to yield a result as traditional centralized data processing. FL is being actively developed, and currently, there are several open-source frameworks that implement it. This article presents a comparative review and analysis of the existing open-source FL frameworks, including their applicability in IoT systems. The authors evaluated the following features of the frameworks: ease of use and deployment, development, analysis capabilities, accuracy, and performance. Three different data sets were used in the experiments—two signal data sets of different volumes and one image data set. To model low-power IoT devices, computing nodes with small resources were defined in the testbed. The research results revealed FL frameworks that could be applied in the IoT systems now, but with certain restrictions on their use.},

Our scheme is validated through several test cases, demonstrating, in particular, its capability of modeling the electrical resistivity and stopping power of a solid-density plasma over a broad parameter range. A relativistic collisional ionization scheme is developed within the same framework, and tested in several physical scenarios. Finally, our scheme is applied in a set of integrated particle-in-cell simulations of laser-driven fast electron transport.},

This report represents the work of the fourth workshop, which focused on the broader scientific opportunities at the frontiers of plasma science. The primary charge to the Panel authoring this report was “to ‘identify’ compelling scientific challenges at the frontiers of plasma physics” and “to ‘identify’ research tools and capabilities to address these challenges in the next decade.” This report aims to inform the newly constituted FES Program in Frontiers of Plasma Science on science opportunities and strategy moving forward. This program was created in FY2015 by combining topics from general plasma science, high energy density laboratory plasmas, and exploratory magnetized plasma into a single program area. The Executive Summary, chapter introductions and sidebars to the chapter are intended to provide more general overviews of the findings of the panel. The chapters provide more details following these themes.},

In particular, spectral solvers and patch based load balancing have a priori non compatible requirements. This paper introduces the Single Domain Multiple Decompositions (SDMD) method in order to address this issue. To do so, different domain decompositions are used for fields and particles operations. This approach allows to keep small domains for particles, necessary for a good load balancing, while having large domains for the fields. It proves beneficial in mitigating synchronization costs and gives the opportunity to introduce more paralellism in the PIC algorithm on top of providing structures compatible with spectral solvers.},

This textbook teaches the field from basic theory of particles and plasmas to observations which culminated in the highly successful Van Allen Probes Mission of NASA in 2012-2019. Using numerous data examples the authors explain the relevant concepts and theoretical background of the extremely complex radiation belt region, with the emphasis on giving a comprehensive and coherent understanding of physical processes affecting the dynamics of the belts. The target audience are doctoral students and young researchers who wish to learn about the physical processes underlying the acceleration, transport and loss of the radiation belt particles in the perspective of the state-of-the-art observations.},

	abstract = {MAP-PACE (MAgnetic field and Plasma experiment—Plasma energy Angle and Composition Experiment) on SELENE (Kaguya) has completed its ∼1.5-year observation of low-energy charged particles around the Moon. MAP-PACE consists of 4 sensors: ESA (Electron Spectrum Analyzer)-S1, ESA-S2, IMA (Ion Mass Analyzer), and IEA (Ion Energy Analyzer). ESA-S1 and S2 measured the distribution function of low-energy electrons in the energy range 6 eV–9 keV and 9 eV–16 keV, respectively. IMA and IEA measured the distribution function of low-energy ions in the energy ranges 7 eV/q–28 keV/q and 7 eV/q–29 keV/q. All the sensors performed quite well as expected from the laboratory experiment carried out before launch. Since each sensor has a hemispherical field of view, two electron sensors and two ion sensors installed on the spacecraft panels opposite each other could cover the full 3-dimensional phase space of low-energy electrons and ions. One of the ion sensors IMA is an energy mass spectrometer. IMA measured mass-specific ion energy spectra that have never before been obtained at a 100 km altitude polar orbit around the Moon. The newly observed data show characteristic ion populations around the Moon. Besides the solar wind, MAP-PACE-IMA found four clearly distinguishable ion populations on the dayside of the Moon: (1) Solar wind protons backscattered at the lunar surface, (2) Solar wind protons reflected by magnetic anomalies on the lunar surface, (3) Reflected/backscattered protons picked-up by the solar wind, and (4) Ions originating from the lunar surface/lunar exosphere.},

	abstract = {The implementation and first results of the new space weather forecasting-targeted inner heliosphere model “European heliospheric forecasting information asset” (EUHFORIA) are presented. EUHFORIA consists of two major components: a coronal model and a heliosphere model including coronal mass ejections. The coronal model provides data-driven solar wind plasma parameters at 0.1 AU by constructing a magnetic field model of the coronal large-scale magnetic field and employing empirical relations to determine the plasma state such as the solar wind speed and mass density. These are then used as boundary conditions to drive a three-dimensional time-dependent magnetohydrodynamics model of the inner heliosphere up to 2 AU. CMEs are injected into the ambient solar wind modeled using the cone model, with their parameters obtained from fits to imaging observations. In addition to detailing the modeling methodology, an initial validation run is presented. The results feature a highly dynamic heliosphere that the model is able to capture in good agreement with in situ observations. Finally, future horizons for the model are outlined.},

	abstract = {The thesis presents the results of all the research from the published and in publication process research in the Journal of Geophysical Research [1]. This research focuses on whistler wave ducting events in the equatorial magnetosphere. High-density ducts are the main focus of whistler study in both studies as they are commonly observed by the Van Allen Probe satellites. A three-step procedure based on the analysis of the whistler wave dispersion relation and numerical simulations of the electron magnetohydrodynamics model. We use this model to identify the parallel and perpendicular wave numbers of the “most trapped” wave in an attempt to understand the filtering aspects of HDD. Statistical analysis was done in a separate study to determine common parameters and characteristics of narrow and wide ducting events. A total of 213 events were cataloged where 164 were narrow events. The narrow HDD were found to most commonly have a duct size between 0-50 km with a density increase of 161\% in the background magnetic field range of 100-300 nT. Wide events are events were the background magnetic field and the density gradient vary in the same direction, either both increases or decreases. The results from the studies show a robust three-step procedure that was applied to an observed event as well as the common characteristics and catalog of events in which this procedure is applicable.},

This eagerly awaited new edition has been fully updated to reflect crucial changes in the programming landscape. Refactoring, Second Edition, features an updated catalog of refactorings and includes JavaScript code examples, as well as new functional examples that demonstrate refactoring without classes. Like the original, this edition explains what refactoring is; why you should refactor; how to recognize code that needs refactoring; and how to actually do it successfully, no matter what language you use. Understand the process and general principles of refactoring Quickly apply useful refactorings to make a program easier to comprehend and change Recognize "bad smells" in code that signal opportunities to refactor Explore the refactorings, each with explanations, motivation, mechanics, and simple examples Build solid tests for your refactorings Recognize tradeoffs and obstacles to refactoring Includes free access to the canonical web edition, with even more refactoring resources.

内容简介:
这本书以小说的形式，通过一名哲学导师向一个叫苏菲的女孩传授哲学知识的经过，揭示了西方哲学发展的历程。由前苏格拉底时代到萨特，以及亚里士多德、笛卡儿、黑格尔等人的思想都通过作者生动的笔触跃然纸上，并配以当时的历史背景加以解释，引人入胜。评论家认为，对于那些从未读过哲学课程的人而言，此书是最为合适的入门书，而对于那些以往读过一些哲学而已忘得一干二净的人士，也可起到温故知新的作用。
14岁的少女苏菲不断接到一些极不寻常的来信，世界像谜团一般在她眼前展开。在一位神秘导师的指引下，苏菲开始思索，她运用少女天生的悟性与后天知识，企图解开这些谜团。然而，事实真相远比她所想的更怪异、更离奇……},

	abstract = {Test-particle simulations provide a useful complement to the kinetic simulations of many-body systems and their approximate treatment with multiple moments. In a kinetic approach, systems are described at a microscopic level in terms of a large number of degrees of freedom. Fluid or multiple moment approaches, however, provide a description at the macroscopic level, in terms of relatively few physical parameters involving averages or moments of particle distribution functions. Ideally, fully kinetic descriptions should be done whenever possible. Due to their complexity, the use of these approaches is often not practical in many cases of interest. In comparison, the fluid approximation is much simpler to implement and solve. It can be used to describe complex phenomena in multi-dimensional geometry with realistic boundary conditions. Its main drawback is its inability to account for many phenomena taking place on fine space or time scales, or phenomena involving nonlocal transport. Macroscopic approaches are also not adapted to describe large deviations from local equilibrium, such as the occurrence of particle beams or otherwise strong anisotropy. With the test-particle method, particle trajectories are calculated using approximated fields obtained from a low level approach, such as multiple moments. Approximate fields can also be obtained from experiments or observations. Assuming that these fields are representative of actual systems, various kinetic and statistical properties of the system can then be calculated, such as particle distribution functions and moments thereof. In this paper, the test-particle method is discussed in the context of classical statistical physics of many-body interacting point particles. Four different formulations of the method are presented, which correspond to four broad categories of the application encountered in the field of plasma physics and astronomy.},

The purpose of this work is to provide a kinetic plasma dispersion relation tool not only the physical model but also the numerical approach be as general/powerful as possible. As a very general application example, we give the final dispersion relations which assume further the equilibrium distribution function be bi-Maxwellian and including parallel drift, two directions of perpendicular drift (i.e., drift across magnetic field), ring beam and loss-cone. Both the electromagnetic and electrostatic versions are provided, with also the Darwin (a.k.a., magnetoinductive or magnetostatic) version. The species can be treated either magnetized or unmagnetized. Later, the equations are transformed to the matrix form be solvable by using the powerful matrix algorithm (Xie and Xiao, 2016), which is the first approach can give all the important solutions of a linear kinetic plasma system without requiring initial guess for root finding and thus can be extremely useful to the community. To the best of our knowledge, the present model is the most comprehensive one in literature for the distribution function constructed bases on Maxwellian, which thus can be applied widely for study waves and instabilities in space, astrophysics, fusion and laser plasma. We limit the present work to non-relativistic case.},

The meeting brought together about 1400 scientists from 105 co- tries around the world to describe, discuss and debate the latest scientific - derstanding of natural and human-driven changes to our planet. It examined the effects of these changes on our societies and our lives, and explored what the future might hold. The presentations drew upon global change science from an exceptionally wide range of disciplines and approaches. Issues of societal importance – the food system, air quality, the carbon cycle, and water resources – were highlighted from both policy and science perspectives. Many of the talks presented the exciting scientific advances of the past decade of international research on global change. Several challenged the scientific community in the future. What are the visionary and creative new approaches needed for studying a complex planetary system in which human activities are in- mately interwoven with natural processes? This volume aims to capture the timeliness and excitement of the science p- sented in Amsterdam. The plenary speakers were given a daunting task: to reproduce their presentations in a way that delivers their scientific messages accurately and in sufficient detail but at the same time reaches a very broad audience well beyond their own disciplines. Furthermore, they were required to do this in just a few pages.},

The text has been thoroughly revised and updated, with each chapter authored by a recognized expert in the field.  Three chapters – Ground Segment, Product Assurance and Spacecraft System Engineering – have been rewritten, and the topic of Assembly, Integration and Verification has been introduced as a new chapter, filling a gap in previous editions.
This edition addresses ‘front-end system-level issues’ such as environment, mission analysis and system engineering, but also progresses to a detailed examination of subsystem elements which represents the core of spacecraft design. This includes mechanical, electrical and thermal aspects, as well as propulsion and control. This quantitative treatment is supplemented by an emphasis on the interactions between elements, which deeply influences the process of spacecraft design.

Adopted on courses worldwide, Spacecraft Systems Engineering is already widely respected by students, researchers and practising engineers in the space engineering sector. It provides a valuable resource for practitioners in a wide spectrum of disciplines, including system and subsystem engineers, spacecraft equipment designers, spacecraft operators, space scientists and those involved in related sectors such as space insurance.

In summary, this is an outstanding resource for aerospace engineering students, and all those involved in the technical aspects of design and engineering in the space sector.},

	title = {Solar wind proton interactions with lunar magnetic anomalies and regolith},
	abstract = {The lunar space environment is shaped by the interaction between the Moon and the solar wind. In the present thesis, we investigate two aspects of this interaction, namely the interaction between solar wind protons and lunar crustal magnetic anomalies, and the interaction between solar wind protons and lunar regolith. We use particle sensors that were carried onboard the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter to analyze solar wind protons that reflect from the Moon, including protons that capture an electron from the lunar regolith and reflect as energetic neutral atoms of hydrogen. We also employ computer simulations and use a hybrid plasma solver to expand on the results from the satellite measurements.

The observations from Chandrayaan-1 reveal that the reflection of solar wind protons from magnetic anomalies is a common phenomenon on the Moon, occurring even at relatively small anomalies that have a lateral extent of less than 100 km. At the largest magnetic anomaly cluster (with a diameter of 1000 km), an average of {\textasciitilde}10\% of the incoming solar wind protons are reflected to space. Our computer simulations show that these reflected proton streams significantly modify the global lunar plasma environment. The reflected protons can enter the lunar wake and impact the lunar nightside surface. They can also reach far upstream of the Moon and disturb the solar wind flow. In the local environment at a 200 km-scale magnetic anomaly, our simulations show a heated and deflected plasma flow and the formation of regions with reduced or increased proton precipitation.

We also observe solar wind protons reflected from the lunar regolith. These proton fluxes are generally lower than those from the magnetic anomalies. We find that the proton reflection efficiency from the regolith varies between {\textasciitilde}0.01\% and {\textasciitilde}1\%, in correlation with changes in the solar wind speed. We link this to a velocity dependent charge-exchange process occurring when the particles leave the lunar regolith. Further, we investigate how the properties of the reflected neutral hydrogen atoms depend on the solar wind temperature. We develop a model to describe this dependence, and use this model to study the plasma precipitation on the Moon when it is in the terrestrial magnetosheath. We then use the results from these and other studies, to model solar wind reflection from the surface of the planet Mercury.},

	abstract = {In seeking for sparse and efficient neural network models, many previous works investigated on enforcing L1 or L0 regularizers to encourage weight sparsity during training. The L0 regularizer measures the parameter sparsity directly and is invariant to the scaling of parameter values, but it cannot provide useful gradients, and therefore requires complex optimization techniques. The L1 regularizer is almost everywhere differentiable and can be easily optimized with gradient descent. Yet it is not scale-invariant, causing the same shrinking rate to all parameters, which is inefficient in increasing sparsity. Inspired by the Hoyer measure (the ratio between L1 and L2 norms) used in traditional compressed sensing problems, we present DeepHoyer, a set of sparsity-inducing regularizers that are both differentiable almost everywhere and scale-invariant. Our experiments show that enforcing DeepHoyer regularizers can produce even sparser neural network models than previous works, under the same accuracy level. We also show that DeepHoyer can be applied to both element-wise and structural pruning.},

However, accurate simulations are often slow to execute, which limits their applicability to extensive parameter exploration, large-scale data analysis, and uncertainty quantification. A promising route to accelerate simulations by building fast emulators with machine learning requires large training datasets, which can be prohibitively expensive to obtain with slow simulations. Here we present a method based on neural architecture search to build accurate emulators even with a limited number of training data. The method successfully emulates simulations in 10 scientific cases including astrophysics, climate science, biogeochemistry, high energy density physics, fusion energy, and seismology, using the same super-architecture, algorithm, and hyperparameters. Our approach also inherently provides emulator uncertainty estimation, adding further confidence in their use. We anticipate this work will accelerate research involving expensive simulations, allow more extensive parameters exploration, and enable new, previously unfeasible computational discovery.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09531},
	abstract = {Federated learning (FL), as an emerging edge artificial intelligence paradigm, enables many edge devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their private data. To enhance the training efficiency of FL, various algorithms have been proposed, ranging from first-order to second-order methods. However, these algorithms cannot be applied in scenarios where the gradient information is not available, e.g., federated black-box attack and federated hyperparameter tuning. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a derivative-free federated zeroth-order optimization (FedZO) algorithm featured by performing multiple local updates based on stochastic gradient estimators in each communication round and enabling partial device participation. Under the non-convex setting, we derive the convergence performance of the FedZO algorithm and characterize the impact of the numbers of local iterates and participating edge devices on the convergence. To enable communication-efficient FedZO over wireless networks, we further propose an over-the-air computation (AirComp) assisted FedZO algorithm. With an appropriate transceiver design, we show that the convergence of AirComp-assisted FedZO can still be preserved under certain signal-to-noise ratio conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedZO algorithm and validate the theoretical observations.},

Linear simulation results have been verified using a numerical Nyquist analysis of the dispersion relation in the slab limit. Global simulations of unstable drift-compressional modes in the dipole geometry with kinetic ions find that finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects reduce the linear growth rate significantly but change little the real frequency. Global eigenmode structures show that the modes are even along the equilibrium magnetic field and broadened by the FLR effects in the radial direction.

	abstract = {作者简介:
彼得·德鲁克小传，管理学科开创者，他被尊为“大师中的大师”、“现代管理学之父”，他的思想传播影响了130多个国家；他称自己是“社会生态学家”，他对社会学和经济学的影响深远，他的著作架起了从工业时代到知识时代的桥梁。

    1909年彼得·德鲁克生于维也纳的一个书香门第，1931年获法兰克福大学国际法博士学位，1937年与他的德国校友多丽丝结婚，并移居美国，终身以教书、著书和咨询为业。

    在美国他曾担任由美国银行和保险公司组成的财团的经济学者，以及美国通用汽车公司、克莱斯勒公司、IBM公司等大企业的管理顾问。为纪念其在管理领域的杰出贡献，克莱蒙特大学的管理研究生院以他的名字命名；为表彰他为非营利领域所带来的巨大影响，国际慈善机构“救世军”授予德鲁克救世军最高奖项“伊万婕琳·布斯奖”。

    他曾连续20年每月为《华尔街日报》撰写专栏文章，一生在《哈佛商业评论》上共发表38篇文章，至今无人打破这项纪录。他著述颇丰，包括《管理的实践》《卓有成效的管理者》《管理：使命、责任、实务》《旁观者》等几十本著作，以30余种文字出版，总销售量超过600万册。其中《管理的实践》奠定了他作为管理学科开创者的地位，而《卓有成效的管理者》已成为全球管理者必读经典。

    他曾7次获得“麦肯锡奖”；2002年6月2013，获得当年的“总统自由勋章”，这是美国公民所能获得的最高荣誉。

    20世纪80年代，德鲁克思想被引入中国；2004年，德鲁克管理学全面进入中国的管理教育。

    2005年11月11日，德鲁克在加州克莱蒙特的家中溘然长逝，享年95岁。

内容简介:
你希望被人记住什么？    即使在平庸者的领导下，许多企业和政府也能够生存很长一段时间。但在非营利组织，领导能力的平庸则会立即暴露出来。因为非营利性组织的成功与否不只一条评价标准，而是有一系列的标准，非营利组织的管理者，必须学会平衡和统筹兼顾，综合考虑评价业绩的一系列标准。    本书关注：    ·非营利组织与企业以及政府机构使命的重大区别    ·究竟什么是“非营利性工作”的成果    ·非营利组织提供服务及获得运营资金的策略    ·因大量依赖志愿者，导致无法推行强制性命令，由此而引起的进行机构改革和调整的种种挑战    ·由于资源的限制，对非营利组织来说，有计划地放弃显得非常重要    ·作为非营利组织的领导，工作重点应该是思考组织使命、实现组织目标、展现组织的社会价值    从使命到绩效，再到策略，德鲁克给我们勾勒出一条清晰、具体的操作方法。    读了本书之后，明天你准备去做些什么事情？什么事情你不打算去做了？},

	abstract = {A novel adaptive technique for electromagnetic Particle In Cell (PIC) plasma simulations is presented here. Two main issues are identified as regards the development of the algorithm. First, the choice of the size of the particle shape function in progressively refined grids, with the decision to avoid both time-dependent shape functions and cumbersome particle-to-grid interpolation techniques, and, second, the necessity to comply with the strict stability constraints of the explicit PIC algorithm. The adaptive implementation presented responds to these demands with the introduction of a Multi Level Multi Domain (MLMD) system, where a cloud of self-similar domains is fully simulated with both fields and particles, and the use of an Implicit Moment PIC method as baseline algorithm for the adaptive evolution. Information is exchanged between the levels with the projection of the field information from the refined to the coarser levels and the interpolation of the boundary conditions for the refined levels from the coarser level fields. Particles are bound to their level of origin and are prevented from transitioning to coarser levels, but are repopulated at the refined grid boundaries with a splitting technique. The presented algorithm is tested against a series of simulation challenges.},

	abstract = {Why did Machiavelli write the Prince - and why did religious and political authorities find it so threatening? Five hundred years on, this book tries to answer these questions. In the first detailed, chapter-by-chapter reading of the Prince in any language, Erica Benner shows that the book is a masterpiece of ironic writing. Machiavelli's style is deliberately ambiguous: he often seems to say one thing, but gives readers clues that point toward a very different message. Beyond its 'Machiavellian' surface, the Prince has a surprisingly moral purpose. It teaches readers how to recognize hidden dangers in political conduct that merely appears great or praiseworthy - and to mistrust promises of easy solutions to political problems. This highly engaging new interpretation helps readers to see beyond the Prince's deceptive first appearances. Benner sets out Machiavelli's main ironic techniques at the outset, especially his coded use of words to signal praise or blame. Once readers become familiar with these codes, they will find it easier to grasp the Prince's surreptitiously pro-republican message - and its powerful critique of charismatic one-man rule and imperial politics},

	abstract = {"This textbook describes Earth's plasma environment from single particle motion in electromagnetic fields, with applications to Earth's magnetosphere, up to plasma wave generation and wave-particle interaction. The origin and effects of collisions and conductivities are discussed in detail, as is the formation of the ionosphere, the origin of magnetospheric convection and magnetospheric dynamics in solar wind-magnetosphere coupling, the evolution of magnetospheric storms, auroral substorms, and auroral phenomena of various kinds. The second half of the book presents the theoretical foundation of space plasma physics, from kinetic theory of plasma through the formation of moment equations and derivation of magnetohydrodynamic theory of plasmas. The validity of this theory is elucidated, and two-fluid theory is presented in more detail. This is followed by a brief analysis of fluid boundaries, with Earth's magnetopause and bow shock as examples. The main emphasis is on the presentation of fluid and kinetic wave theory, deriving the relevant wave modes in a high temperature space plasma. Plasma instability is the most important topic in all applications and is discussed separately, including a section on thermal fluctuations. These theories are applied to the most interesting problems in space plasma physics, collisionless reconnection and collisionless shock waves with references provided. The Appendix includes the most recent developments in the theory of statistical particle distributions in space plasma, the Kappa distribution, etc, also including a section on space plasma turbulence and emphasizing on new observational developments with a dimensional derivation of the Kolmogorov spectrum, which might be instructive for the student who may worry about its origin. The book ends with a section on space climatology, space meteorology and space weather, a new application field in space plasma physics that is of vital interest when considering the possible hazards to civilization from space"--},

	abstract = {At the Earth's magnetopause, a low-energy ion population of ionospheric origin is commonly observed at the magnetospheric side. In this work we use a 2-D fully kinetic simulation to identify several original signatures related to the dynamics of cold ions involved in magnetic reconnection at the asymmetric dayside magnetopause. We identify several original signatures of the cold ions dynamics driven by the development of magnetic reconnection at the asymmetric dayside magnetopause. We find that cold ions tend to rarefy in the diffusion region, while their density is enhanced as a result of compression along magnetospheric separatrices. We also observe the formation of crescent-shaped cold ion distribution functions along the separatrices in the near-exhaust region, and we present an analytical model to explain this signature. Finally, we give evidence of a localized parallel heating of cold ions. These signatures should be detected with the magnetospheric multiscale mission high-resolution observations.},

However, it was the first time that a man-made spacecraft had landed there and actually left behind wheel prints belonging to humanity.Since China's Lunar Exploration Project (CLEP), or Chang'e Project, started in 2004, China has accomplished the first two steps of its three-step plan of ‘Orbiting, Landing and Returning’. CE-3 and CE-4 landed successfully on the near-side and far-side of the Moon, respectively. In the near future, CE-5 will land again on the near-side of the Moon and take lunar rock and soil samples back to Earth, thus completing the three-step plan of CLEP. In April 2019, National Science Review (NSR) interviewed three key figures of CLEP: CLEP Chief Engineer Weiren Wu (), the first CLEP Chief Scientist and CLEP senior consultant Ziyuan Ouyang (), and CLEP third phase Vice-Chief Engineer, CE-4 Ground Research and Application System Director Chunlai Li (). They talked about the scientific expectations and future plans of China's lunar and deep space exploration.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13696},
	abstract = {While gravitational microlensing by planetary systems provides unique vistas on the properties of exoplanets, observations of a given 2-body microlensing event can often be interpreted with multiple distinct physical configurations. Such ambiguities are typically attributed to the close-wide and inner-outer types of degeneracies that arise from transformation invariances and symmetries of microlensing caustics. However, there remain unexplained inconsistencies between aforementioned theories and observations. Here, leveraging a fast machine learning inference framework, we present the discovery of the offset degeneracy, which concerns a magnification-matching behaviour on the lens-axis and is formulated independent of caustics. This offset degeneracy unifies the close-wide and inner-outer degeneracies, generalises to resonant topologies, and upon reanalysis, not only appears ubiquitous in previously published planetary events with 2-fold degenerate solutions, but also resolves prior inconsistencies. Our analysis demonstrates that degenerate caustics do not strictly result in degenerate magnifications and that the commonly invoked close-wide degeneracy essentially never arises in actual events. Moreover, it is shown that parameters in offset degenerate configurations are related by a simple expression. This suggests the existence of a deeper symmetry in the equations governing 2-body lenses than previously recognised.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05085},
	abstract = {The offset microlensing degeneracy, recently proposed by Zhang et al. (2021), has been shown to generalize the close-wide and inner-outer caustic degeneracies into a unified regime of magnification degeneracy in the interpretation of 2-body planetary microlensing observations. The offset degeneracy states that for two planetary lenses that differ only in the projected star-planet separation (\$s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm A\}{\textbackslash}neq s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}\$), the source trajectory is required to cross their point of equal magnification on the lens-axis, located at \$u=(s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm A\}-1/s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm A\}+s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}-1/s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\})/2\$ from the primary, to give rise to degenerate observations. Crucially, the above formalism applies to all three caustic topologies, and implies that the \$s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm A\}=1/s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}\$ solution of the close-wide degeneracy never strictly manifests in microlensing observations unless \$u=0\$. However, the offset degeneracy was proposed upon numerical calculations, and no theoretical justification was given. Here, we provide a theoretical treatment of the offset degeneracy, which demonstrates its nature as a mathematical degeneracy. From first principles, we show that the offset degeneracy formalism is exact to zeroth-order in the mass ratio (\$q\$) for two cases: when the source crosses the lens-axis inside of caustics, and for \$(s\_A-s\_B){\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash}ll1\$ when crossing outside of caustics. The extent to which the offset degeneracy persists in oblique source trajectories is explored numerically. Additionally, it is shown that the superposition principle allows for a straightforward generalization to \$N\$-body microlenses with \$N\$-1 planetary lens components (\$q{\textbackslash}ll1\$), which results in a \$2{\textasciicircum}\{N-1\}\$-fold degeneracy. Lastly, we demonstrate that the recently proposed "\$s{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger\$" heuristic results from the \$s{\textbackslash}rightarrow1\$ limit of the offset degeneracy, and thus does not correctly unify the close-wide and inner-outer degeneracies.},

	abstract = {Fast and automated inference of binary-lens, single-source (2L1S) microlensing events with sampling-based Bayesian algorithms (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC) is challenged on two fronts: the high computational cost of likelihood evaluations with microlensing simulation codes, and a pathological parameter space where the negative-log-likelihood surface can contain a multitude of local minima that are narrow and deep. Analysis of 2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-loop domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-free inference approach named amortized neural posterior estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a surrogate posterior as an observation-parameterized conditional probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors within seconds for any observation within the prior support without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior could then be refined into the exact posterior with a downstream MCMC sampler with minimal burn-in steps.},

	abstract = {This thesis describes the essential features of Moon-plasma interactions with a particular emphasis on the Earth's magnetotail plasma regime from both observational and theoretical standpoints. The Moon lacks a dense atmosphere as well as a strong intrinsic magnetic field. As a result, its interactions with the ambient plasma are drastically different from solar-wind interactions with magnetized planets such as Earth. The Moon encounters a wide range of plasma regime from the relatively dense, cold, supersonic solar-wind plasma to the low-density, hot, subsonic plasma in the geomagnetic tail. In this book, the author presents a series of new observations from recent lunar missions (i.e., Kaguya, ARTEMIS, and Chandrayaan-1), demonstrating the importance of the electron gyro-scale dynamics, plasma of lunar origin, and hot plasma interactions with lunar magnetic anomalies. The similarity and difference between the Moon-plasma interactions in the geomagnetic tail and those in the solar wind are discussed throughout the thesis. The basic knowledge presented in this book can be applied to plasma interactions with airless bodies throughout the solar system and beyond.},

The map has characteristics similar to those of previous maps but better resolves the shapes and distribution of weaker anomalies. The strongest group of anomalies is located on the northwest side of the South Pole-Aitken basin approximately antipodal to the Imbrium basin. On the near side, both strong isolated anomalies and weaker elongated anomalies tend to lie along lines oriented radial to Imbrium. These include named anomalies such as Reiner Gamma, Hartwig, Descartes, Abel, and Airy. The statistical significance of this tendency for elongated anomalies is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Great circle paths determined by end points of elongated anomaly groups and the locations of five individual strong anomalies converge within the inner rim of Imbrium and intersect within the Imbrium antipode zone. Statistically significant evidence for similar alignments northwest of the Orientale basin is also found. The observed distribution of anomalies on the near side and the location of the strongest anomaly group antipodal to Imbrium are consistent with the hypothesis that iron from the Imbrium impactor was mixed into ejecta that was inhomogeneously deposited downrange in groups aligned radial to the basin and concentrated antipodal to the basin.},

Here we study the global effects of protons reflected from lunar crustal magnetic fields on the lunar plasma environment when the Moon is in the unperturbed solar wind. We employ a three-dimensional hybrid model of plasma and an observed map of reflected protons from lunar magnetic anomalies over the lunar farside. We observe that magnetic fields and plasma upstream over the lunar crustal fields compress to nearly 120\% and 160\% of the solar wind, respectively. We find that these disturbances convect downstream in the vicinity of the lunar wake, while their relative magnitudes decrease. In addition, solar wind protons are disturbed and heated at compression regions and their velocity distribution changes from Maxwellian to a non-Maxwellian. Finally, we show that these features persists, independent of the details of the ion reflection by the magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {Investigation of the lunar crustal magnetic anomalies offers a comprehensive long-term data set of observations of small-scale magnetic fields and their interaction with the solar wind. In this paper a review of the observations of lunar mini-magnetospheres is compared quantifiably with theoretical kinetic-scale plasma physics and 3D particle-in-cell simulations. The aim of this paper is to provide a complete picture of all the aspects of the phenomena and to show how the observations from all the different and international missions interrelate. The analysis shows that the simulations are consistent with the formation of miniature (smaller than the ion Larmor orbit) collisionless shocks and miniature magnetospheric cavities, which has not been demonstrated previously. The simulations reproduce the finesse and form of the differential proton patterns that are believed to be responsible for the creation of both the “lunar swirls” and “dark lanes.” Using a mature plasma physics code like OSIRIS allows us, for the first time, to make a side-by-side comparison between model and space observations. This is shown for all of the key plasma parameters observed to date by spacecraft, including the spectral imaging data of the lunar swirls. The analysis of miniature magnetic structures offers insight into multi-scale mechanisms and kinetic-scale aspects of planetary magnetospheres.},

From 2015 April to 2016 February 665 intervals could be identified where Rosetta was located in a zero-magnetic-field region. We study the temporal and spatial distribution of this cavity and its boundary and conclude that the cavity properties depend on the long-term trend of the outgassing rate, but do not respond to transient events at the spacecraft location, such as outbursts or high neutral densities. Using an empirical model of the outgassing rate, we find a functional relationship between the outgassing rate and the distance of the cavity to the nucleus. There is also no indication that this unexpectedly large distance is related to unusual solar wind conditions. Because the deduced shape of the cavity boundary is roughly elliptical on small scales and the distances of the boundary from the nucleus are much larger than expected we conclude that the events observed by Rosetta are due to a moving instability of the cavity boundary itself.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the first local hybrid simulations (particle ions and fluid electrons) for the solar wind plasma interaction with realistic lunar crustal fields. We use a three-dimensional hybrid model of plasma and an empirical model of the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly based on Lunar Prospector observations. We examine the effects of low and high solar wind dynamic pressures on this interaction when the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly is located at nearly 20∘ solar zenith angle. We find that for low solar wind dynamic pressure, the crustal fields mostly deflect the solar wind plasma, form a plasma void at very close distances to the Moon (below 20 km above the surface), and reflect nearly 5\% of the solar wind in charged form. In contrast, during high solar wind dynamic pressure, the crustal fields are more compressed, the solar wind is less deflected, and the lunar surface is less shielded from impinging solar wind flux, but the solar wind ion reflection is more locally intensified (up to 25\%) compared to low dynamic pressures. The difference is associated with an electrostatic potential that forms over the Gerasimovich magnetic anomaly as well as the effects of solar wind plasma on the crustal fields during low and high dynamic pressures. Finally, we show that an antimoonward Hall electric field is the dominant electric field for ∼3 km altitude and higher, and an ambipolar electric field has a noticeable contribution to the electric field at close distances ({\textless}3 km) to the Moon.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new fully kinetic electrostatic simulation, HYBes, to study how the lunar landscape affects the electric potential and plasma distributions near the surface and the properties of lifted dust. The model embodies new techniques that can be used in various types of physical environments and situations. We demonstrate the applicability of the new model in a situation involving three charged particle species, which are solar wind electrons and protons, and lunar photoelectrons. Properties of dust are studied with test particle simulations by using the electric fields derived from the HYBes model. Simulations show the high importance of the plasma and the electric potential near the surface. For comparison, the electric potential gradients near the landscapes with feature sizes of the order of the Debye length are much larger than those near a flat surface at different solar zenith angles. Furthermore, dust test particle simulations indicate that the landscape relief influences the dust location over the surface. The study suggests that the local landscape has to be taken into account when the distributions of plasma and dust above lunar surface are studied. The HYBes model can be applied not only at the Moon but also on a wide range of airless planetary objects such as Mercury, other planetary moons, asteroids, and nonactive comets.},

We find that the effective size of the obstacle depends on the relative orientation between the dipolar and plasma internal magnetic fields, and we show that this may be critical to form a shock in small-scale structures. We study the microphysics of the magnetopause in different magnetic field configurations in 2D and compare the results with full 3D simulations. Finally, we evaluate the parameter range where such miniature magnetized shocks can be explored in laboratory experiments.},

意大利当代最具有世界影响的作家。于1985年获得诺贝尔文学提名，却因于当年猝然去世而与该奖失之交臂。但其人其作早已在意大利文学界乃至世界文学界产生巨大影响。
卡尔维诺从事文学创作40年，一直尝试着用各种手法表现当代人的生活和心灵。他的作品融现实主义、超现实主义与后现代主义于一身，以丰富的手法、奇特的角度构造超乎想像的、富有浓厚童话意味的故事，深为当代作家推崇，并给他们带来深刻影响。《我们的祖先》三部曲、《命运交叉的城堡》、《帕洛马尔》等达到惊人的艺术高度和思想深度。《意大利童话》最大限度地保持了意大利民间口头故事的原貌，艺术价值和学术价值兼具，是再现意大利“民族记忆”之深厚积淀的不可多得的作品。《美国讲稿》是卡尔维诺对自己近40年小说创作实践的丰富经验进行的系统回顾和理论上的总结与阐发。他的作品以特有的方式反映了时代，更超越了时代。

内容简介:
王小波、苏童、阿城、止庵是他的忠实粉丝
朱天文，唐诺是卡尔维诺不余遗力的传播者
梁文道说他一直在准备谈卡尔维诺，可是一直没准备好
权威版本，全面修订2006年单行本译本，并增补卡尔维诺各作品自序、后记、注释等重要资料
知名设计师全新装帧，精装双封 设计，书脊烫金，封面采用原创线条图，赋予每部作品文学个性
这本书首次将卡尔维诺从一九六四年起讲的所有宇宙奇趣故事收录在同一本书中。本书也起到了一个有趣的作用，即把现代科学艰涩难懂的概念，变得轻松而可见，达到建立一种更接近宇宙起源之神话而非科学小说的文学种类。},

These codes are used to model phenomena on ion inertial and gyro-radius scales, which fall between longer scales obtained by magnetohydrodynamic simulations and shorter scales attainable by full particle simulations. In this tutorial, the assumptions and equations of the hybrid model are described along with some most commonly used numerical implementations. Modifications to include finite electron mass are also briefly discussed. Examples of results of two-dimensional hybrid simulations are used to illustrate the method, to indicate some of the tradeoffs that need to be addressed in a realistic calculation, and to demonstrate the utility of the technique for problems of contemporary interest. Some speculation about the future direction of space physics research using hybrid codes is also provided.},

Hall magnetohydrodynamics is important for plasma dynamics on length scales less than the ion inertial scale length but greater than the electron inertial length. On these scales the ion and electron motions are decoupled; the electrons remain frozen to the magnetic field but the ions are not. In this paper we provide a basic overview of Hall magnetodydrodynamics with an emphasis on numerical methods. We also provide several concrete examples of Hall dynamics: whistler waves, Hall drift waves, plasma opening switch dynamics, and three dimensional magnetic reconnection.},

	abstract = {The Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer (SARA) instrument on the Indian Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has produced for the first time an image of a lunar magnetic anomaly in backscattered hydrogen atoms. The image shows that a partial void of the solar wind, a mini-magnetosphere, is formed above the strong magnetic anomaly near the Crisium antipode. The mini-magnetosphere is 360 km across at the surface and is surrounded by a 300-km-thick region of enhanced plasma flux that results from the solar wind flowing around the mini-magnetosphere. The mini-magnetosphere is visible only in hydrogen atoms with energy exceeding 150 eV. Fluxes with energies below 100 eV do not show corresponding spatial variations. While the high-energy atoms result from the backscattering process, the origin of the low-energy component is puzzling. These observations reveal a new class of objects, mini-magnetospheres, and demonstrate a new observational technique to study airless bodies, imaging in backscattered neutral atoms.},

Second, it discusses many of the results in linear filtering theory. This includes several important properties of linear filters as stability and model error sensitivity. The book also emphasizes on the applications of the linear theory to nonlinear problems, and treats the current problem area of filter divergence. The unifying theme in the book is the probabilistic or Bayesian approach. The chapter develops the nonlinear theory and obtains linear filtering algorithms as special cases of the nonlinear results. The chapter also includes many of the more popular derivations of linear filters in examples.},

The continuous state space, discrete parameter processes are referred to as random sequences. A continuous state space, continuous parameter process is often called a stochastic process or simply a process. Such a process is sometimes called as random function. A stochastic process is really a function of two variables, the time parameter t and the probability parameter ω.

The collision free electron skin depth, ξe = cωpe, where c is the velocity of light and ωpe, is the plasma frequency, gives a classical measure of the penetration depth of a collisionless plasma by an electromagnetic field. This penetration depth is small compared with the dimensions of the magnetosphere and hence the boundary layer may be conveniently considered in one dimension. In General all one dimensional solutions lie within an order of magnitude of the value of ξe, the only exception being the important one, in which the electric field perpendicular to the current sheath plane is not present, either due to a particular trapped particle distribution or due to a short circuiting end effect. For this exception the thickness is increased by the factor (mii/me)12. The current sheath solutions discussed are equilibrium solutions but not necessarily stable equilibrium solutions. The extension of the models to three dimensions has a larger effect than might at first be expected. The effect may be intuitively understood as a consequence of flux conservation in the sheath. The one dimensional solutions then correspond to the current sheath profiles at the thinnest point of the three dimensional sheath.},

	abstract = {We have analyzed nongyrotropic electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) obtained near the lunar surface. Electron VDFs, measured at ∼10–100 km altitude by Kaguya in both the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, exhibit nongyrotropic empty regions associated with the ‘gyroloss’ effect; i.e., electron absorption by the lunar surface combined with electron gyromotion. Particle-trace calculations allow us to derive theoretical forbidden regions in the electron VDFs, thereby taking into account the modifications due to nonuniform magnetic fields caused by diamagnetic-current systems, lunar-surface charging, and electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic field. Comparison between the observed empty regions with the theoretically derived forbidden regions suggests that various components modify the characteristics of the nongyrotropic electron VDFs depending on the ambient-plasma conditions. On the lunar nightside in the magnetotail lobes, negative surface potentials slightly reduce the size of the forbidden regions, but there are no distinct effects of either the diamagnetic current or perpendicular electric fields. On the dayside in the solar wind, the observations suggest the presence of either the diamagnetic-current or solar wind convection electric field effects, or both. In the terrestrial plasma sheet, all three mechanisms can substantially modify the characteristics of the forbidden regions. The observations imply the presence of a local electric field of at least 5 mV/m although the mechanism responsible for production of such a strong electric field is unknown. Analysis of nongyrotropic VDFs associated with the gyroloss effect near solid surfaces can promote a better understanding of the near-surface plasma environment and of plasma–solid-surface interactions.},

Rapid diffusion of interplanetary magnetic field lines through the lunar body limits the effective average electrical conductivity to a maximum value of 10−5 mho/m. Thus capture of interplanetary magnetic field lines by the moon and formation of a lunar magnetosphere as theorized by Gold is not substantiated. A lunar bow shock wave has not yet been observed when the moon is located in the interplanetary medium or the magnetosheath of the earth.},

IMP-8 observations are used to determine baseline IMF conditions, and therefore determine those features in the WIND data which are related to its proximity to the moon. Previous Explorer 35 observations suggest that the lunar wake is not detectable beyond a downstream distance of ∼4 RL. However, despite the distance of WIND from the moon, we observe a slight decrease in field intensity just prior to the spacecraft entering the optical shadow, a slight field strength enhancement whilst in shadow, and perhaps a weak depression once the spacecraft reemerges into sunlight. These signatures closely resemble, but are weaker than, the previous observations. We conclude that a lunar wake did extend to these distances at the time of this encounter. We also note a rotation in field direction some distance outside of the wake signature which may be attributed to the crossing of the lunar mach cone boundary. We discuss the observations in terms of simple models of the solar wind interaction with an insulating body.},

	abstract = {Left-handed, circular polarized ULF waves with frequency of 0.3−1.1 Hz were detected by GEOTAIL at 27 lunar radii upstream of the moon when the spacecraft was magnetically connected with the lunar wake. The wave was detected twice at 16:45–17:00 and 18:55–19:02 on October 25, 1994, when the spacecraft and the moon were on the dawn side of the Earth’s magnetosphere. The ULF wave was propagating in a direction nearly parallel to the background magnetic field. The observed frequency and polarization are explained by reversal of polarization of right-handed, sunward-propagating electron whistler waves with frequencies above 1.4 Hz in the solar wind frame of reference, which were excited through the interaction with electron beams flowing in anti-sunward direction downstream of the lunar wake. The downstream flow of electron beam is explained by filtering effect of the potential drop at the boundary of the lunar wake. Low-energy components of electrons are reflected back by the potential drop, and the rest components, with energies higher than that of the electric potential penetrate through the wake. The velocity distribution of downstream electrons would be modified to have some bump or shoulder in energy range to form a beam, which is likely to excite whistler mode wave through cyclotron resonance. The lowest energy of the resonant electrons was calculated to be 0.96–2.5 (keV) from the lower boundary of the detected frequency. The variation in the lowest frequency suggests that there are some regions of the lunar wake where potential drop is reduced.},

We show that SW protons sneak into the deepest lunar wake (anti-subsolar region at ∼100 km altitude), and that the entry yields strong asymmetry of the near-Moon wake environment. Particle trajectory calculations demonstrate that these SW protons are once scattered at the lunar dayside surface, picked-up by the SW motional electric field, and finally sneak into the deepest wake. Our results mean that the SW protons scattered at the lunar dayside surface and coming into the night side region are crucial for plasma environment in the wake, suggesting absorption of ambient SW electrons into the wake to maintain quasi-neutrality.},

	abstract = {Federated learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning scheme that allows multiple data owners to work collaboratively while ensuring data privacy. The success of federated learning depends largely on the participation of data owners. To sustain and encourage data owners' participation, it is crucial to fairly evaluate the quality of the data provided by the data owners and reward them correspondingly. Federated Shapley value, recently proposed by Wang et al. [Federated Learning, 2020], is a measure for data value under the framework of federated learning that satisfies many desired properties for data valuation. However, there are still factors of potential unfairness in the design of federated Shapley value because two data owners with the same local data may not receive the same evaluation. We propose a new measure called completed federated Shapley value to improve the fairness of federated Shapley value. The design depends on completing a matrix consisting of all the possible contributions by different subsets of the data owners. It is shown under mild conditions that this matrix is approximately low-rank by leveraging concepts and tools from optimization. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation verify that the proposed measure does improve fairness in many circumstances.},

In the hooked chorus element, the frequency increases first, and then decreases. Interestingly, we find that there are clear electron holes in the electron velocity space, no matter whether the chorus element has a rising-tone or hooked-tone spectrogram.

Space plasma simulations can be used to investigate energy transfer, acceleration, and plasma flows on both global and local scales. Simulation of global magnetospheric dynamics requires spatial and temporal scales currently achievable through magnetohydrodynamics or hybrid-kinetic simulations, which approximate electron dynamics as a charge-neutralizing fluid. We introduce a novel method for Vlasov-simulating electrons in the context of a hybrid-kinetic framework in order to examine the energization processes of magnetospheric electrons. Our extension of the Vlasiator hybrid-Vlasov code utilizes the global simulation dynamics of the hybrid method whilst modelling snapshots of electron dynamics on global spatial scales and temporal scales suitable for electron physics. Our eVlasiator model is shown to be stable both for single-cell and small-scale domains, and the solver successfully models Langmuir waves and Bernstein modes. We simulate a small test-case section of the near-Earth magnetotail plasma sheet region, reproducing a number of electron distribution function features found in spacecraft measurements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Modeling of laser-plasma wakefield accelerators in an optimal frame of reference [1] has been shown to produce orders of magnitude speed-up of calculations from first principles. Obtaining these speedups required mitigation of a high-frequency instability that otherwise limits effectiveness. In this paper, methods are presented which mitigated the observed instability, including an electromagnetic solver with tunable coefficients, its extension to accommodate Perfectly Matched Layers and Friedman’s damping algorithms, as well as an efficient large bandwidth digital filter. It is observed that choosing the frame of the wake as the frame of reference allows for higher levels of filtering or damping than is possible in other frames for the same accuracy. Detailed testing also revealed the existence of a singular time step at which the instability level is minimized, independently of numerical dispersion. A combination of the techniques presented in this paper prove to be very efficient at controlling the instability, allowing for efficient direct modeling of 10GeV class laser plasma accelerator stages. The methods developed in this paper may have broader application, to other Lorentz-boosted simulations and Particle-In-Cell simulations in general.},

To date, the acceleration mechanism of electrons that create auroral beads is not fully determined. Here, we present a fortuitous event when the Van Allen Probe A (RBSP-A) was in magnetic conjunction with auroral beads. RBSP-A observed Alfvén waves, locally generated kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) and Alfvénic accelerated electrons at several 100 eV. The Alfvén waves and KAWs carried sufficient Poynting flux to power visible aurora and may control the beads' motion. These observations and previous simulations support that the Alfvénic acceleration is the acceleration mechanism of the auroral beads. Specifically, KAWs are generated around the equator and accelerate local cold electrons to several 100 eV. The waves are suggested to propagate to both hemispheres and accelerate electrons to several keV, which directly account for the auroral beads.},

	abstract = {The hot solar atmosphere continually expands out into space to form the solar wind, which drags with it the Sun’s magnetic field. This creates a cavity in the interstellar medium, extending far past the outer planets, within which the solar magnetic-field dominates. While the physical mechanisms by which the solar atmosphere is heated are still debated, the resulting solar wind can be readily understood in terms of the pressure difference between the hot, dense solar atmosphere and the cold, tenuous interstellar medium. This results in an accelerating solar-wind profile which becomes supersonic long before it reaches Earth orbit. The large-scale structure of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind is that of an Archimedean spiral, owing to the radial solar-wind flow away from the Sun and the rotation of the magnetic footpoints with the solar surface. Within this relatively simple picture, however, is a range of substructure, on all observable time and spatial scales. Solar-wind flows are largely bimodal in character. “Fast” wind comes from open magnetic-field regions, which have a single connection to the solar surface. “Slow” wind, on the other hand, appears to come from the vicinity of closed magnetic field regions, which have both ends connected to the Sun. Interaction of fast and slow wind leads to patterns of solar-wind compression and expansion which sweep past Earth. Within this relatively stable structure of flows, huge episodic eruptions of solar material further perturb conditions. At the smaller scales, turbulent eddies create unpredictable variations in solar-wind conditions. These solar-wind structures are of great interest as they give rise to space weather that can adversely affect space- and ground-based technologies, as well as pose a threat to humans in space.},

Electron reflection maps of the regions antipodal to the Imbrium and Serenitatis impact basins, extending to 80°S latitude, show that crustal magnetic fields fill most of the antipodal zones of those basins. This finding provides further evidence for the hypothesis that basin-forming impacts result in magnetization of the lunar crust at their antipodes. The crustal magnetic fields of the Imbrium antipode region are strong enough to deflect the solar wind and form a miniature (100 to several hundred kilometers across) magnetosphere, magnetosheath, and bow shock system.},

	abstract = {The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite was launched on 5 February 2002. Its objective is to study the energy release and particle acceleration in solar flares through observations of X-rays and gamma rays. Two novel technologies are combined to obtain both spectra and images over a broad energy range. For the spectroscopy, cooled hyperpure germanium detectors are used to cover the energy range from 3 keV to 17 MeV with unprecedented keV-class resolution. Since focusing optics are not possible for making images with such high energy photons, tungsten and molybdenum absorbing grids are used to modulate the X-rays and gamma-rays coming from the Sun as the spacecraft rotates. This allows the spatial Fourier components of the source to be determined so that images can be made in spectral ranges where astronomical images have never been produced before. These new instrumental techniques require equally innovative software to reconstruct X-ray and gamma-ray spectra and images from the observations.
Ample solar activity, abundant observations, and an open data policy have attracted many researchers. Astronomers face in the RHESSI mission an exciting new scientific potential. It has unusually broad possibilities for improving our understanding of the enigmatic solar flare phenomenon that is becoming increasingly important as society depends more and more on space-based technologies.
In this volume, the functioning of RHESSI is explained, the data analysis techniques including spectroscopy and image reconstruction are introduced, and the experiences of the first few months of operation are summarized. First scientific results are presented that provide the essential base for more extended studies using RHESSI data and complementary observations by instruments on other spacecraft and at ground-based solar observatories.
Scientists and students will find here the latest discoveries in solar flare research, as well as inspiration for future work. The papers will serve as references for the many new discoveries to come from the continuing RHESSI observations.},

Swirls exhibit distinctive spectral properties at both highland and mare locations that are plausibly explained by fine-grained dust sorting. The sorting may result from two processes that are fairly well established on the Moon, but have not been previously considered together. The first process is the vertical electrostatic lofting of charged fine dust. The second process is the development of electrostatic potentials at magnetic anomalies as solar wind protons penetrate more deeply into the magnetic field than electrons. The electrostatic potential can attract or repel charged fine-grained dust that has been lofted. Since the finest fraction of the lunar soil is bright and contributes significantly to the spectral properties of the lunar regolith, the horizontal accumulation or removal of fine dust can change a surface’s spectral properties. This mechanism can explain some of the spectral properties of swirls, accommodates their association with magnetic fields, and permits aspects of weathering by micrometeoroids and the solar wind.},

	abstract = {Since the Moon is not shielded by a global magnetic field or by an atmosphere, solar wind plasma impinges onto the lunar surface almost unhindered. Until recently, it was assumed that almost all of the impinging solar wind ions are absorbed by the surface. However, recent Interstellar Boundary Explorer, Chandrayaan-1, and Kaguya observations showed that the interaction process between the solar wind ions and the lunar surface is more complex than previously assumed. In contrast to previous assumptions, a large fraction of the impinging solar wind ions is backscattered as energetic neutral atoms. Using the complete Chandrayaan-1 Energetic Neutral Analyzer data set, we compute a global solar wind reflection ratio of 0.16 ± 0.05 from the lunar surface. Since these backscattered neutral particles are not affected by any electric or magnetic fields, each particle's point of origin on the lunar surface can be determined in a straight-forward manner allowing us to create energetic neutral atom maps of the lunar surface. The energetic neutral atom measurements recorded by the Chandrayaan-1 Energetic Neutral Analyzer cover ∼89\% of the lunar surface, whereby the lunar farside is almost completely covered. We analyzed all available energetic neutral atom measurements recorded by the Chandrayaan-1 Energetic Neutral Analyzer to create the first global energetic neutral hydrogen maps of the lunar surface.},

AMR reduces the computational cost and memory footprint compared to a uniform mesh while preserving accurate descriptions of different physical processes in complex multiphysics algorithms. AMReX supports algorithms that solve systems of partial differential equations in simple or complex geometries and those that use particles and/or particle–mesh operations to represent component physical processes.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the numerical issues related to the modeling of beams or plasmas crossing at relativistic velocity using the particle-in-cell method. Issues related to the use of the standard Boris particle pusher are identified and a novel pusher which circumvents them is proposed, whose effectiveness is demonstrated on single particle tests. A procedure for solving the fields is proposed, which retains electrostatic, magnetostatic, and inductive field effects in the direction of the mean velocity of the species, is fully explicit and simpler than the full Darwin approximation. Finally, results are given, from a calculation using the novel features, of an ultrarelativistic beam interacting with a background of electrons.},
